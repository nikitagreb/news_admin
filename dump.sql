Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and the First Amendment. He contrasted Facebook’s position with that of China, where the authorities control and censor speech, and which he tried unsuccessfully for years to enter to turbocharge his company’s business.</p><p>“People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world — a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,” Mr. Zuckerberg, 35, said.</p><p>He added that despite the messiness of free speech, “the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.”</p><p>The address by the tech billionaire was an unusually public doubling down on free expression online as debate over that stance has ramped up. It was a sign that Mr. Zuckerberg was going on the offense against critics who have accused Facebook of being an amplifier of disinformation, hate speech and violent content.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg made his stand as Facebook has grappled with a firestorm over political speech in recent weeks. Last month, the company unveiled a sweeping policy in which it said it would not moderate politicians’ speech or fact-check their political ads because the comments by political leaders, even if false, were newsworthy and in the public’s interest to hear and debate.</p><p>That quickly drew condemnation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, accused Facebook of being a “disinformation-for-profit machine.” Marc Benioff, chief executive of the software company Salesforce, said the social network “needs to be held accountable for propaganda on its platform.” And civil rights groups censured the company for allowing lies and falsehoods to appear on its site.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg’s speech was also lambasted.</p><p>“Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company’s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,” said Bill Russo, a spokesman for the presidential campaign of Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>Facebook’s position on political speech is part of a growing divide between social media companies and traditional media companies. Twitter, too, has said it will not remove accounts of politicians who appear to violate its policies against violent speech because the posts add to discourse.</p><p>In contrast, traditional media companies — including cable channels like CNN, MSNBC and CNBC — have taken a harder line by declining to air political ads with false content.</p><p>Facebook’s policy on political speech was put to the test this month when the Trump campaign released a 30-second video ad that falsely claimed Mr. Biden committed corrupt acts in Ukraine. The ad played across social media outlets and on some broadcast networks; CNN and NBCU declined to air it because they said the ad violated their standards.</p><p>When Mr. Biden’s campaign asked Facebook to take down the false ad, the social network refused. Ms. Warren later dared Facebook by deliberately creating an inaccurate political ad that said Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were backing Mr. Trump’s re-election, even though neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor his company have announced their support of a candidate.</p><p>“We decided to see just how far it goes,” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter of her move.</p><p>Civil rights groups said they were stunned by how hands-off Facebook was being on political speech. By giving politicians free rein to post any material — even lies — that potentially sets up the social network for more disinformation efforts ahead of the 2020 election, they said.</p><p>Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition representing 220 civil rights groups, said she spoke to Mr. Zuckerberg last week to express alarm about the policy. She said he told her the public could make its own determinations about false statements and racially divisive content from politicians.</p><p>“Mark Zuckerberg is co-opting civil rights history to try to justify Facebook’s policies that do long-term damage to our democracy,” Ms. Gupta said. “The company is in denial about what’s happening.”</p><p>Neil Chilson, a senior research fellow at Stand Together, an organization within the Koch Network, said Facebook’s free speech position was “a very reasonable policy choice.” When Mr. Trump speaks, reporters then fact-check what he says, showing “that the cure to a politician’s misstatement is more speech, not to shut it down,” Mr. Chilson said.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg decided in recent days to publicly speak at Georgetown University as the debate over Facebook’s position on political discourse became louder. On Wednesday, he posted on Facebook that he was writing a speech that was “the most comprehensive take I’ve written about my views, why I believe voice is important.”</p><p>He will continue his public offensive on Friday, when he plans to be interviewed by Dana Perino of Fox News. Next week, he will be in Washington for a hearing on the company’s cryptocurrency project, called Libra. It will be his second time testifying in front of Congress after April 2018, when he answered lawmakers’ questions on Facebook’s treatment of user data.</p><p>In an interview at Facebook’s Silicon Valley headquarters on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out more of the reasoning behind his speech. He repeatedly cited Facebook’s role as an American company and how it would be viewed over time.</p><p>“Today, the state of the global internet around the world is primarily defined by American companies and platforms with strong free expression values,” he said. “There’s just no guarantee that will win out over time.”</p><p>In his speech, he said he had considered banning political ads from Facebook. But he said political advertising could be considered part of speech and that the slope of deciding which issues were political and which were not would be too slippery to navigate. He added that political ads were a negligible amount of Facebook’s $55.8 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged in the interview that his position would not satisfy everyone. But he said he wrote the address to lay out his broader views and how he wanted his company to operate long into the future — including the far-off day when he is no longer running Facebook.</p><p>“I hope this is a moment for us to put our place in history in perspective,” he said.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:41:28', '2019-10-17 20:41:28', 'defiant-zuckerberg-says-facebook-wont-police-political-speech'),

Deal Saves One Plant, Union Says, but 3 Others Stay Shut', 'The United Automobile Workers said the tentative contract agreement would provide wage increases and improve the prospects of temporary employees.', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/business/17motors1/merlin_162856257_b26cc0cb-fb9c-425d-9fb9-bbb4f85ba966-facebookJumbo.jpg', '<p>DETROIT — General Motors has agreed to continue production at a Detroit plant it had planned to shut down, but will not resume operations at three others recently idled, the United Automobile Workers union said Thursday in announcing the terms of a tentative contract agreement.</p><p>The details were released as leaders of the union’s G.M. locals gathered in Detroit to learn and consider the terms. If they accept the tentative agreement, they could call an immediate end to a monthlong strike. They could also continue the walkout until the deal is ratified by a majority of the 49,000 U.A.W. members employed by G.M.</p><p>According to a summary posted online by the union, the four-year deal includes wage increases and a formula for allowing temporary workers to become full-time employees.</p><p>It would also keep open the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which G.M. had said it would close.</p><p>The tentative agreement does not reverse plans for three plants where production has ceased, including one in Lordstown, Ohio, though it provides retirement incentives for workers displaced there.</p><p>G.M. has promised to invest $7.7 billion in its manufacturing operations in the United States over the next four years, and another $1.3 billion in ventures with partners, saying those moves would create or preserve 9,000 jobs. But the deal includes no specific promises to expand domestic production or to move manufacturing to the United States from Mexico, both of which were goals of the union going into the negotiations.</p><p>If the contract is ratified, each full-fledged U.A.W. worker will receive a signing bonus of $11,000, a 3 percent wage increase in the second and fourth years of the contract, and a 4 percent lump sum in the first and third years. Temporary workers get a signing bonus of $4,500, the same wage increases as full-time workers, and the possibility of becoming permanent employees within three years.</p><p>The deal also eliminates a $12,000 cap on annual profit-sharing payouts, which could have a significant upside if G.M. continues to be as profitable as it has been in recent years.</p><p>Health care benefits are unchanged, with workers paying about 3 percent of the cost.</p><p>When it announced the tentative accord on Wednesday, the U.A.W. said it had “achieved major wins.” But ratification is not a foregone conclusion. The last time the union negotiated a contract with G.M., in 2015, approval was delayed for a month in part because the automaker’s skilled-trades workers rejected the terms.</p><p>A rejection of the proposed contract would be a rebuke for the U.A.W. president, Gary Jones, and his negotiating team.</p><p>“If the rank-and-file vote down an agreement their leaders send them, they also are voting down the leaders,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry. “Workers may ask whether it was worth being out of work a month to get a deal that could be close to what they would have gotten with no strike and no loss of pay.”</p><p>There were signs of dissent from union members outside the Renaissance Center office complex, where G.M. is headquartered and the contract negotiations took place. As the roughly 200 union officials who will vote on the proposed contract arrived for the meeting, they were greeted by about 30 workers from the Lordstown plant in red T-shirts shouting, “Vote no!”</p><p>“If we don’t have product in Lordstown, we want them to vote no on this contract,” said Anthony Naples, a father of five who worked for 25 years at the Lordstown plant. “Now our jobs are going away. They have to figure out a way to get product in the U.S.”</p><p>One of the union’s main objectives was getting G.M. to reopen the car factory in Lordstown, a goal that President Trump endorsed. But there is no indication that the matter was ever on the table in the contract talks. G.M. idled that plant, and others in Baltimore and in Warren, Mich., as part of a cost-cutting effort that eliminated 2,800 factory jobs and thousands of white-collar positions.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, General Motors said it was looking into building a battery factory near Lordstown that would employ about 1,000 workers. The plant would be built with a partner and would be unionized, but under a separate contract.</p><p>An electric-truck company that hopes to purchase the Lordstown plant from G.M. would employ about 400 production workers, the automaker said.</p><p>The company has not indicated that displaced workers from its Lordstown plant would be given preference in hiring at either operation.</p><p>G.M. reaffirmed a plan announced in May to invest $700 million in three existing plants in Ohio — in Parma, Toledo, and the Dayton area — with an expected net gain of 450 jobs.</p><p>“G.M. is committed to future investment and job growth in Ohio,” the company said.</p><p>If the G.M. contract is ratified, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to Ford Motor or Fiat Chrysler. Contracts with those manufacturers expired on Sept. 14, but workers continued reporting to assembly lines while the union negotiated with G.M.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:42:14', '2019-10-17 20:42:14', 'gm-deal-saves-one-plant-union-says-but-3-others-stay-shut'),

In second place — who would have guessed? — is “The Umbrella Academy,” with 45 million views.</p><p>For Netflix original movies, the most watched are the Sandra Bullock thriller “Bird Box,” with an eye-opening 80 million views, and the Adam Sandler comedy “Murder Mystery,” with 73 million.</p><p>The data shows broader trends, too. High school comedies are especially popular on the service, both for television and movies, as are some Spanish-language series.</p><p>Hollywood has expressed irritation with Netflix’s selective disclosures of its viewership numbers from the moment the company started going public with them. Executives at other entertainment companies — whose shows succeed or fail based largely on ratings measured by the research firm Nielsen — have groused that the Netflix numbers did not correspond to any traditional statistics, that they were inflated and that they highlighted successes while ignoring the scores of series and movies that failed to attract significant audiences.</p><p>But the decision to go public with even some of its data was something of an about-face for Netflix, which once claimed it never wanted to get involved in the weekly Hollywood competition based on ratings or box office receipts.</p><p>For a movie, according to the statistics that have appeared in the earnings reports, a view denotes that 70 percent of it was watched within four weeks of its premiere. For a television series, the company counts a view as a streaming of 70 percent of one episode within four weeks of the day it appeared on the service.</p><p>The Netflix numbers do not correspond to any traditional metric used by the entertainment industry.</p><p>For instance, Netflix reported in January that 40 million households had watched “You,” a drama from the prolific producer Greg Berlanti. By the Nielsen measure, a typical episode of “You” would have an audience of eight million viewers in the United States, according to the cable network FX, which has access to the Nielsen data.</p><p>“An average audience of eight million viewers is good, but it’s not an average audience of 40 million total viewers, which would make ‘You’ the No. 1 show on American television,” John Landgraf, the head of FX, said when he revealed the Nielsen number.</p><p>Netflix would not confirm that the data in its earnings reports had amounted to official most-watched lists for its movies and shows. “We select a few titles to highlight each quarter, but they are not meant to be a comprehensive list of top performers,” a Netflix spokesman said.</p><p>In a call with investors on Wednesday, Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, suggested that the company could start making information about its most popular shows more widely available, potentially going beyond the “Popular on Netflix” and “Now Trending” sections of the welcome screen for subscribers in the United States. The reason? Viewers like knowing what’s popular.</p><p>“If they want to use that as a tool to help guide their decision making, we want to help them do it,” he said on the earnings call.</p><p>Netflix has started testing the use of Top 10 lists for subscribers in Britain and Mexico. Last month, users in those regions were presented with titles for the most popular Netflix shows on any given day, the Netflix spokesman said. Those lists included the entire library of content on the service at that moment, with licensed programs like “Friends” appearing alongside Netflix originals like “Dead to Me.”</p><p>In the final three months of the year, Netflix has several series and movies that could elbow their way onto a top 10 list, including “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie”; the third season of “The Crown”; Ryan Murphy’s first streaming series, “The Politician” (which debuted on Sept. 27); and Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:43:21', '2019-10-17 20:43:21', 'netflixs-top-10-original-movies-and-tv-shows-according-to-netflix'),

They create a double whammy for Scotland.</p><p>Whisky underpins the economy of Islay (pronounced EYE-la) and much of Scotland. Kilchoman and eight rival Scotch whisky distilleries have flourished here in the past decade. Tourists from the United States, Europe and Japan come to wonder at Islay’s coastal beauty, take pictures of hillsides filled with sheep and hairy Highland cattle that look as if they’ve had vigorous blow dries, and soak up the pricey local spirits.</p><p>Annual exports of Scotch whisky are worth 4.7 billion pounds, or about $5.9 billion, accounting for 70 percent of Scotland’s food and drink exports and 21 percent of Britain’s.</p><p>More than £1 billion worth of the strong stuff goes to the United States. Almost £1.4 billion is sold in the European Union.</p><p>As enthusiasm for single malt has grown, whisky tourism has rocketed. About two million visitors toured this year, double the number about a decade ago, according to the Scotch Whisky Association, a trade group. Most hail from Germany and the United States, and distillers like Mr. Wills have readily wrung profit from their thirst. Connoisseurs can be seen sipping whisky on tours of Kilchoman, the huge gleaming copper stills in action nearby.</p><p>And there is some romance to finding the right tipple. Tourists drive past peat bogs and deep blue lochs on their way to the distilleries. Water from the lochs is rendered into a fine fiery spirit. The peat and salty air flavor what they drink. Even a deep breath near a distillery offers a back-of-the-throat alcoholic tinge.</p><p>Mr. Wills has spent nearly half his career distilling this experience into something that newcomers can quaff. His single malt has become a popular export, and he can’t believe the predicament his distillery faces. He frets aloud about the cost of absorbing the 25 percent tariffs. He exports 80 percent of all that he makes, and sells about 40,000 bottles a year in the United States. Sales in America have helped spur growth for the past nine years.</p><p>Brexit has been a sort of self-imposed pain in the United Kingdom, he said. The Trump tariffs add salt to the wound. “We’re a growing business, and you need all the support you can get,” he added in exasperation.</p><p>Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the Trump administration’s decision to apply tariffs only to single malts was likely to hit smaller producers harder.</p><p>“The combination of tariffs in our most valuable market and mitigating the potential impact of Brexit is tough,” she said.</p><p>Distillers like Mr. Wills cannot lure their American customers to alternative, blended whiskies because they do not produce them, and single malt has been marketed as distinctive, focused on provenance.</p><p>Liam Hughes, chief executive of a small distiller in Glasgow, said his company had just sealed a deal to sell whisky to the United States when the tariffs were announced.</p><p>“We were all celebrating, and we wake up the next morning and find a 25 percent tariff overnight has been injected into the equation,” Mr. Hughes said in a telephone interview before flying to Japan to introduce Glasgow Distillery products there.</p><p>His distillery spent more than £100,000 and prepared for 18 months to begin exporting to the United States. The company installed two new stills to double production to 1.2 million bottles a year. He hired six more people. The staff has been rushing to prepare molds and design new labels for the larger bottles required in the United States.</p><p>Mr. Hughes had been planning to release a special whisky with a barrel maker in Kentucky. “Now the cost of that release will increase by 25 percent, which could be prohibitive,” he said.</p><p>He likened the last few days in Scotland to being a small boat in stormy seas “being buffeted left, right and center.” “It obviously makes us extremely nervous,” Mr. Hughes said, being “caught up in a trade dispute that has nothing to do with us.”</p><p>Even consumers — or least a few happy tourists taking a dram this week on Islay — found the tariffs a rebuke to global ambitions and business.</p><p>“Some of our most important allies in the world” have been “betrayed by this administration because they can’t see the value in free trade and fair trade,” said Jeremy Henderson, 34, from Portland, Ore.</p><p>“I would drink Scotch sort of in defiance of that.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:44:29', '2019-10-17 20:44:29', 'a-scotch-makers-challenge-first-brexit-now-tariffs'),

Bill Warner, the founder of the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance in Florida, estimates that only 30 people do this type of first-class occupational time travel.</p><p>“It is a modern-day Degas or Renoir that these guys create from just basic metal,” Mr. Warner said.</p><p>One such craftsman is Mike Kleeves.</p><p>Mr. Kleeves, 62, has been fixing wayback machines for four decades, his life a traffic jam of damaged Ferraris, Porsches, Delahayes, Jaguars and Bugattis.</p><p>[Read more about automobiles.]</p><p>His Automobile Metal Shaping business in Morganton, N.C., can recreate a body panel — or the entire body — of a car made long ago by companies known as coachbuilders.</p><p>Until the 1930s, people who wanted a luxury vehicle would often buy a chassis, which is basically all of the mechanical pieces that make a vehicle move, and then decide what they wanted it to look like. A coachbuilder would create the body and attach it.</p><p>Mr. Kleeves said repairs to those bodies were not just a matter of fixing them. They should honor the way the car was created as long as 100 years ago.</p><p>He starts with a flat piece of metal, sometimes steel and sometimes aluminum. While a computer may be used to help get the correct dimensions, the shape of the panel is guided largely by hand, with what ultimately amounts to a series of hammer taps.</p><p>The close attention to historical detail includes putting welds in the same place and having a forge in the shop, because if a bracket on a car was originally forged, well, the repair must use a forged bracket.</p><p>Mr. Kleeves said he often thought about the original coachbuilders.</p><p>“They took great pride in their work. They put their heart and soul and life into it,” he said. And he feels obliged to pay homage to that with “a proper piece.”</p><p>That “proper piece” can take a year or more to build and cost between $300,000 and $500,000, assuming an entirely new body is not needed.</p><p>Early on in his career, Mr. Kleeves worked in conventional body shops, helping repair everyday cars damaged in everyday accidents. But his skills got a significant boost when he worked for the metal shapers John Glover and Harry Kennedy.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Glover and Mr. Kennedy were working at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Mich., building prototypes.</p><p>Mr. Glover, 90, remembers a young Mr. Kleeves walking into their shop, fascinated by their work. They agreed to teach him.</p><p>It became apparent that he was talented, said Mr. Glover, who now lives in Macomb Township, Mich. “I showed him all I could. He was like a sponge.”</p><p>Now, Mr. Kleeves’s reputation is such that the businessman Peter Mullin selected him for an ambitious and unusual project that would be housed in Mr. Mullin’s automotive museum in Oxnard, Calif.</p><p>Among Mr. Mullin’s collection of pre-World War II French automobiles was the chassis of a 1939 Bugatti Type 64 Coupe, built by Jean Bugatti. It had all the necessary mechanical pieces, such as an engine and suspension, but it was half naked: No body sat atop. Bugatti was killed in a crash in 1939 before he could create it.</p><p>Only three Type 64s were ever made, and only two are known to exist.</p><p>Mr. Mullin wanted to create a body for his coupe. He asked Stewart Reed of the ArtCenter College of Design to design it and Mr. Kleeves to construct it.</p><p>The body was finished in 2013, after 14 months and about 5,500 man-hours.</p><p>“When I first laid eyes on the newly bodied 1939 Bugatti Type 64 Coupe, I was amazed at the work that had taken place,” Mr. Mullin said in an email. “It was extraordinary to see the car come to fruition.”</p><p>The Type 64 is now on display at the Mullin Automotive Museum. Neither Mr. Kleeves nor Mr. Mullin would disclose the cost.</p><p>The work of auto restorers can get lost in the glitter of what they do and whom they do it for.</p><p>“A lot of these guys do this fabulous work for very wealthy people, and the wealthy people get the trophies and the guys who do the work don’t get anything,” Mr. Warner of the Amelia Island Concours said.</p><p>Mr. Warner created the Phil Hill/Craftsman Award to remedy this. In 2015, Mr. Kleeves received the inaugural award, named after a Formula One world champion and winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p><p>“He is an exceptional craftsman,” Mr. Warner said. “There are only a handful of people who can do what Mike Kleeves does.”</p><p>For Mr. Kleeves, the reward is being part of preserving some of the finest moments of automotive history.</p><p>“To be able to touch and feel from that time period is a blessing,” he said.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:46:07', '2019-10-17 20:46:07', 'when-a-ferraris-in-a-fender-bender'),

Unless Venezuela’s national oil company makes a $913 million payment on its 2020 bonds that is due Oct. 28, creditors and companies that have lost assets to nationalizations by Venezuela’s socialist government could try to seize Citgo.</p><p>“Everyone wants the Citgo assets because it’s the only way to get paid,” said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University.</p><p>Bondholders, the Trump administration and Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader whom the United States, the European Union and other governments consider Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, are engaged in a flurry of negotiations to avert a breakup of the company.</p><p>Several Republican lawmakers are pressing President Trump to prevent a breakup of Citgo, which they argue could pose a security threat to the United States. The lawmakers assert that Rosneft, an oil giant controlled by the Russian government, could pick up some of the pieces because Citgo shares are collateral for a Russian loan to Venezuela — an outcome that experts say is unlikely.</p><p>Valued at around $10 billion, Citgo is by far Venezuela’s most valuable overseas asset. More than that, it has long been the gateway for the South American country’s heavy oil into the United States, its most important market by far. With an economy in tatters and an estimated $150 billion in debts, Venezuela desperately needs Citgo.</p><p>But for the moment Citgo is a pawn in a struggle between the Trump administration and the government of President Nicolás Maduro, and its principal allies, Cuba and Russia.</p><p>American sanctions against the Maduro government have blocked fuel shipments between Citgo and Venezuela since January. And the company is now controlled by a board appointed by Mr. Guaidó, the National Assembly leader, who declared himself interim president on the grounds that Mr. Maduro had won a 2018 presidential election through fraud.</p><p>Since the Guaidó-appointed board took control, Citgo has replaced its crude imports from Venezuela with oil from other Latin American countries and Africa.</p><p>Mr. Maduro has asserted that American sanctions are designed to steal Citgo from Venezuela and that Mr. Guaidó is a puppet of the Trump administration.</p><p>Struggling to pay for imported food and medicine, Mr. Maduro’s government has stopped making payments on most of its debts.</p><p>Trying to protect Citgo from dismemberment, the board appointed by Mr. Guaidó has already made one small payment on the debts of the national oil company, best known by its acronym, PDVSA.</p><p>“What Citgo is needed for is to support the recovery of Venezuela once PDVSA is under the full control of Guaidó,” said Lisa Viscidi, a specialist on Latin American energy issues at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington.</p><p>But Mr. Guaidó’s position has weakened in recent months after he made several unsuccessful attempts to push Mr. Maduro out of power with mass demonstrations and calls on the military to remove him.</p><p>Mr. Guaidó does not control the country’s cash flow from its oil sales and therefore does not have the money to make the Oct. 28 payment. He, Citgo executives and several prominent members of Congress have lobbied the Trump administration to prevent a breakup of the company, which would be another blow to Mr. Guaidó and his claim to be the lawful president of Venezuela.</p><p>President Trump could reverse a narrow sanctions exemption issued by the Treasury Department that gave investors who own PDVSA’s 2020 bonds an exception from rules that prohibit United States businesses from conducting financial transactions involving Venezuelan assets. The exemption was put in place last year to prevent Mr. Maduro from citing American sanctions as a reason not to pay bondholders.</p><p>But now the exemption, which gives bondholders the right to acquire Citgo shares as payment, would end up hurting Mr. Guaidó, not Mr. Maduro. Citgo is a profitable company and can pay the interest due on its own debt, but it would struggle to shoulder PDVSA’s debt.</p><p>Members of a committee of Venezuela bondholders, led by Greylock Capital Management and T. Rowe Price, have proposed to the administration and Mr. Guaidó that they allow the creditors to lend more money to forestall a default. The investors have not defined the form of that loan, but it presumably would add to PDVSA’s debts.</p><p>“No one wants to see them unnecessarily default,” said Ajata Mediratta, Greylock’s managing partner, president and portfolio manager. “A number of creditors have explicitly offered to assist the Guaidó administration in making this payment. But the quid pro quo is that creditors would like the Guaidó administration to work with creditors to nudge the U.S. Treasury to amend the trading sanctions.”</p><p>A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment on Thursday.</p><p>The opposition-controlled National Assembly declared this week that the 2020 bonds were not valid because the assembly had not approved them. Bondholders say that argument might not hold up in an American court.</p><p>Exacerbating Citgo’s jeopardy, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia ruled last month that Crystallex International, a Canadian gold-mining company, could lay claim to shares of Citgo. In 2011, the Venezuelan government, then led by Hugo Chávez, nationalized Crystallex’s share of a mining project. Mr. Maduro’s government paid the company $500 million toward a $1.4 billion debt last year, but neglected to pay other installments agreed upon in arbitration.</p><p>Other potential claimants include ConocoPhillips, which has been awarded over $10 billion by international tribunals for its Venezuelan projects expropriated by Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. That Houston-based oil company has so far not sought to acquire Citgo, attempting to be paid directly through an arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan government.</p><p>Financial analysts expect that holders of the PDVSA bonds would be first in line to receive shares in Citgo, since the $3.4 billion 2020 bonds are secured by 50.1 percent of Citgo shares. Ashmore Group, a London investment firm, has the largest bond holding, and other creditors could initiate legal proceedings to auction off Citgo to the highest bidder to recoup the money they are owed.</p><p>The remaining 49.9 percent secured loans to PDVSA by Rosneft, the Russian oil company, which is active in Venezuelan oil fields.</p><p>Several American lawmakers, including Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas have called on the administration to protect Citgo’s 5,300 employees and keep the company from falling under Russian control.</p><p>”The potential for Rosneft to have any control of a U.S. company poses a major threat and exposes critical infrastructure to national security threats,” the two Republican senators, who have allied themselves with Mr. Trump on numerous issues, and five other lawmakers wrote to the president this month.</p><p>But experts say a takeover by Rosneft is highly unlikely.</p><p>In recent months, a Panamanian affiliate of Rosneft has taken control of marketing Venezuelan oil internationally. Rosneft has received accelerated payments on its loans, and Venezuela’s debts to Rosneft may be completely paid off by the end of the year.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:47:12', '2019-10-17 20:47:12', 'its-the-only-way-to-get-paid-a-struggle-for-citgo-venezuelas-us-oil-company'),

European leaders must approve the deal, and crucially, so does the British Parliament. Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, reached an accord with the E.U., only to see it rejected three times by lawmakers.</p><p>An ally of Mr. Johnson, the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, said earlier this morning that it won’t accept the deal as it currently stands. And Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said that he expects members of his party to reject it.</p><p>The British pound surged this morning to $1.29, suggesting that investors believe this deal will be passed by Parliament.</p><h2>G.M. and the U.A.W. are close to ending monthlong strike</h2><p>The two sides reached a tentative contract deal yesterday that could end the automaker’s longest strike in half a century. But the actual walkout could end today — or in several weeks’ time.</p><p>What’s in the four-year agreement:</p><p>• A signing bonus of more than $8,000</p><p>• Wage increases of 3 percent in some years and lump-sum payments of 4 percent in others</p><p>• A pathway to permanent employment for temporary workers</p><p>But it isn’t clear how some contentious matters have been settled.

The union wanted to reduce pay disparities within its work force and compel G.M. to commit to producing future vehicles in the U.S. The company sought to reduce health care costs and limit wage and benefits increases.</p><p>Local union leaders will decide today whether to end the strike immediately, or after the new contract is approved by union members.</p><p>If the deal is approved, the U.A.W. will then use it as a model for discussions with Ford and Fiat Chrysler. But those talks may go more smoothly because each company did less to shift auto production south of the border.</p><h2>Netflix is already feeling heat from the streaming wars</h2><p>The streaming giant rebounded from losses last quarter and added 6.8 million new subscribers in the third quarter, Ed Lee of the NYT reports. It’s a potentially hopeful sign for the company as rival online video services prepare to launch soon.</p><p>Netflix beat Wall Street’s profit expectations, earning $665 million on $5.2 billion in revenue. Its stock price jumped more than 8 percent in after-hours trading, though its market value has dropped more than 20 percent after its last report in July.</p><p>But the bump was still lower than Netflix had forecast. The company had expected to add about seven million customers.</p><p>And its new subscriber forecast hinted at pending competition from Apple, Disney, AT&amp;T and others, Mr. Lee writes. The company said it would add 7.6 million new customers in the next quarter, below the 9.4 million that Wall Street had expected.</p><p>Reed Hastings, Netflix’s C.E.O., says he isn’t worried. “Fundamentally there’s not a big change here,” Mr. Hastings said on the earnings call after the announcement. “We’re all competing against linear television, not really competing against each other.”</p><p>More: How Disney is “betting the whole company on streaming.”</p><h2>There’s reason to worry about China’s pledge on U.S. farm goods</h2><p>A key part of President Trump’s “Phase 1” trade agreement with China from last week was a pledge by Beijing to buy more U.S. farm products. But Chao Deng and Lingling Wei of the WSJ point out that plenty of uncertainty still surrounds the promise.</p><p>China agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural goods per year, a huge increase from both the current levels of roughly $13 billion and the pre-trade war peak of about $25 billion.</p><p>But Chinese negotiators are insisting that purchases “must be based on actual demand and at fair-market prices,” the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources. And such purchases would likely require Beijing to rely heavily on state-owned companies to buy the goods.</p><p>Analysts think China could add some conditions, such as stretching out the time frame for such purchases or relying on interpretations of W.T.O. rules that prohibit managed trade.</p><p>“There’s so much that can happen in the next few weeks to undermine” the $50 billion target that Mr. Trump announced, Wendy Cutler, a former Asia negotiator for the U.S. trade representative, told the WSJ.</p><p>More: Scotch producers already had to contend with Brexit — and now they must figure out how to deal with new U.S. tariffs that begin tomorrow. And the head of Germany’s central bank said that global trade tensions could slow economic growth worldwide.</p><h2>The E.U.’s antitrust chief takes aggressive tack on Broadcom</h2><p>Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition official, invoked a rarely used rule to order the semiconductor company to halt a potentially anticompetitive practice while it is under investigation, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.</p><p>An investigation into the chip maker began in June. The company is accused of using exclusivity agreements to prevent customers from using products from its rivals.</p><p>Ms. Vestager said Broadcom’s competitors may be forced out of business if the company’s actions were not stopped, which is why she decided to use “interim measures” during the inquiry. “It is the first time the regulator has used the rule in nearly two decades, signaling urgency within Europe to keep the technology market competitive,” Mr. Satariano writes.</p><p>“Companies have resisted the use of interim measures, arguing that the move amounts to reaching a verdict in a trial that is still underway,” Mr. Satariano notes.</p><p>The case could have ramifications for other tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google that the E.U. is investigating over potentially anticompetitive practices. “The European authorities have handed out billions of dollars in antitrust penalties against technology giants, but have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to match the plans of the fast-paced industry,” Mr. Satariano writes.</p><h2>Libra’s chief defends the cryptocurrency</h2><p>David Marcus, a co-creator of Facebook’s Libra, said the project is “absolutely not” in jeopardy following the exodus of several corporate partners — including Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal — Brian Cheung of Yahoo Finance reports.</p><p>Mr. Marcus said that “regulatory matters” weren’t behind the seven departures from the project, Mr. Cheung writes, “despite commentary from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assuming that ‘some of the partners got concerned and dropped out’ over rules like anti-money laundering standards.”</p><p>Governments so far have been skeptical of Libra, with policymakers questioning whether the cryptocurrency could be used for crimes like money laundering. Facebook’s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, is scheduled to testify before Congress next week about the project.</p><p>“It’s kind of odd that all of this is happening at the stage of this project because it’s a project,” Mr. Marcus told CNBC. ”It’s an idea. It’s a white paper. Nothing is operating yet.”</p><p>More: What went wrong at Libra?</p><h2>The mystery of the suspiciously well-timed Trump tariff trades</h2><p>President Trump can move markets with his freewheeling comments on China and more. But Bill Cohan of Vanity Fair points out several instances in which someone placed bets on the S&amp;P 500 ahead of time — and made huge profits, at least on paper.</p><p>• On Sept. 10, someone bought 82,000 S&amp;P “e-minis,” which are futures contracts linked to the S&amp;P 500. Soon later, the Chinese government and Mr. Trump said they would suspend some levies. The subsequent market rise led to a one-day profit of roughly $190 million.</p><p>• On Aug. 23, someone bought 386,000 e-minis in the last 10 minutes of trading. Three days later, Mr. Trump asserted that he had gotten a call from China about restarting trade talks, which Chinese officials later denied. Nevertheless, the S&amp;P 500 jumped, creating a paper profit of more than $1.5 billion.</p><p>• On June 28, someone bought 420,000 e-minis in the last 30 minutes of trading, or 40 percent of the day’s trading volume in those contracts. The next day, Mr. Trump said that trade talks were “back on track.” The markets climbed sharply upon reopening, and by a week later the trade reaped a paper profit of nearly $1.8 billion.</p><p>Representatives for the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission declined to comment or didn’t respond to comment. A representative for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which hosts trading in e-minis, said the trades didn’t originate from a single source and weren’t a concern.</p><p>“But the precision and timing of these trades, and the vast amount of money being made as a result of them, make the traders wonder if all this is on the level,” Mr. Cohan writes. “Essentially, do they have inside information?”</p><h2>Revolving door</h2><p>KKR named Pete Stavros and Nat Taylor as the co-heads of its flagship Americas private equity unit; Mattia Caprioli and Philipp Freise as co-heads of the business in Europe; and Hiro Hirano and Ashish Shastry as co-heads of the division in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Citigroup named Peter Babej, the global head of its financial institutions investment banking group, as the new C.E.O. of its Asia Pacific operations.</p><p>Bank of America has rehired Joe McIntosh from Equity Group Investments as a managing director in its industrials investment banking group.</p><p>XPO Logistics hired Aris Kekedjian, a former chief investment officer for G.E., as a director.</p><h2>The speed read</h2><p>Deals</p><p>• The F.C.C. formally approved T-Mobile’s $26 billion takeover of Sprint, but the closing remains delayed because of a lawsuit from several states seeking to block the transaction.

Transit schedules like subway and bus hours help drivers identify daily ride request patterns, while a forecast for rain in the next hour can let them know more business is coming soon.</p><p>“There’s fragmentation and a lack of transparency of information on what’s happening in real time and what’s going to happen,” Mr. Green said. “We’re connecting bread crumbs across data areas.”</p><p>Sergio Avedian, a senior contributor for  The Rideshare Guy website and a driver coach, says the apps can help drivers, especially those new to the job, plan out their day, position themselves in the right places at the right time and wait for the most lucrative fares. “Drivers who just turn on Lyft or Uber and take whatever rides it sends are not making as much as they could,” Mr. Avedian said.</p><p>When a driver who uses both Uber and Lyft accepts a ride request, he or she will switch off the other service (ignoring or turning down ride requests can hurt a driver’s standing). Thanks to all that switching, their records of time and miles driven are fragmented. Services that stay on in the background all day can track miles driven and dollars earned per mile or per hour, for tax purposes and to analyze revenue.</p><p>Gridwise and other apps can also help give drivers a big-picture view. For example, knowing that a number of planes are landing and not that many drivers are at the airport could encourage more Uber and Lyft traffic.</p><p>There is one hurdle, however: Lyft and Uber aren’t always keen on sharing their data. There’s a basic misalignment of goals, said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy.</p><p>Drivers want to maximize their revenue, Mr. Campbell said, while ride-share companies strive to keep prices low for customers and to become profitable. The companies want drivers and riders to use only their service, but drivers and riders are looking for choice.</p><p>For drivers, safety is another concern. The Mystro app lets drivers who work for Lyft and Uber automatically accept rides based on their set preferences; when a ride is accepted on Lyft, say, the app switches off Uber. These are actions a driver would otherwise have to perform manually.</p><p>When Lyft turned off Mystro’s access earlier this year, drivers complained.</p><p>Doug Feigelson, Mystro’s chief executive, found a new technical approach to connect with Lyft’s information and is rolling it out. “Lyft is not helping us with this,” he said.</p><p>The ancillary apps face a number of other challenges. Ride-share companies have begun adding information like event schedules in some cities, so the new apps “have to distinguish themselves by providing a layer of information that Uber and Lyft can’t provide or are not willing to provide,” Mr. Campbell said.</p><p>Driver turnover is high and those who quit altogether also usually cease using the ancillary app. “The most successful apps provide some kind of service the customer could still use after they stop being a ride-share driver,” Mr. Campbell said.</p><p>There are a host of other niches the apps are aiming to fill. When demand is high, Lyft and Uber charge riders higher “surge” prices, which translate to higher pay for drivers.</p><p>An app called Surge provides Uber drivers the ability to monitor their current location or fixed locations for surges. They can receive notifications when surges start, change and end. With this information, they can decide when to go online and accept rides. They can also put pins in a map to be notified of surges in those areas. Receiving a surge notification, they sometimes turn off all ride-share apps until they arrive in the area, so they are not called to a non-surge trip on the way.</p><p>SherpaShare uses location tracking to chart the mileage driven, and at the end of each trip, the driver indicates its purpose as work or leisure. Drivers can deduct 58 cents per mile driven from their taxes as a business expense, so it’s important to keep track, and the app can create I.R.S.-compliant reports for tax purposes. TripLog and Everlance are other similar apps that some drivers have come to rely on.</p><p>Ride-share drivers use a number of other categories of apps more than the typical mobile user does, according to Lexi Sydow, senior market insights manager at  App Annie mobile insights and analytics. These include banking, parking, gas loyalty and car maintenance apps. They are also more likely to use job seeking apps like  ZipRecruiter.</p><p>The drivers aren’t alone in juggling Uber and Lyft. Passengers will often call up each app to see if one ride is substantially cheaper. Both Google Maps and Apple Maps display some ride-share options, depending on location.</p><p>The app Migo shows passengers local ride-share options as well as bikes, scooters, taxis, public transit and car shares. When Lyft and Uber ceased working with it, the company recently shifted its focus to smaller and international ride-share companies like RideAustin in Texas and  GETT in Israel and Britain.</p><p>International markets have a much richer set of mobility options, said Jeff Warren, founder of Migo. It’s hard, though, for travelers to do the research to find the best local ride-share companies and then download each app and enter payment information, he said.</p><p>Migo aims to solve that problem by integrating access to those services into its app, including the ability to book and pay for the ride. In Paris for example, Migo will have about a dozen choices for travelers.</p><p>The number of new entrants in this field is expected to keep rising, because there is a great need, Mr. Campbell said. “Riders are looking for options,” he said, “and drivers are looking for ways to stay ahead of the competition.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:50:12', '2019-10-17 20:50:12', 'these-apps-are-an-uber-drivers-co-pilot'),

The New York Times selected people from all over the world who are pushing the boundaries of their fields, from science and technology to culture and sports.</p><p>Sometimes it’s better not to know the obstacles that exist when creating something new.</p><p>That was certainly true for Andrew Kassoy, who, along with Jay Coen Gilbert and Bart Houlahan, two friends and roommates from Stanford University, wanted to encourage companies to focus on their employees and the environment. In 2006, they left their jobs and created B Lab, which certifies companies that operate for social good, in addition to trying to make money. Think Fair Trade for food or LEED certification for environmentally sustainable buildings.</p><p>Certified companies — referred to as B Corps — are businesses with verified social and environmental performances, including factors such as sustainability, income inequality and the impact on local communities. They are, essentially, companies that use business as a force of good, rather than focusing solely on profit maximization. Companies like Patagonia, Eileen Fisher and Danone North America have all been certified; over all, there are more than 3,000 certified B Corps in 71 countries, Mr. Kassoy said.</p><p>Mr. Kassoy and his friends had not anticipated that the success of their efforts would also hinge on convincing individual state legislatures, as well as foreign countries, to amend their corporate laws. But through legwork, persistence and the help of some dedicated outside lawyers, the three slowly effected legal change in 37 states, including in Delaware, where more than two-thirds of the Fortune 500 and 80 percent of public companies are incorporated, according to state statistics.</p><p>Mr. Kassoy’s work presaged a theme that in the last year has been adopted by business leaders like Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Inc., as well as the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, who are urging corporate accountability in areas like the treatment of employees and the impact on the environment, in addition to shareholder returns.</p><p>Mr. Kassoy — who emphasized that B Lab was created by, and is still run by, all three men equally — discussed how the organization continues to work to transform global capital markets.</p><p>The following conversation has been edited and condensed.</p><p>What would you like people to know about your work?</p><p>We started B Lab because we thought there had to be a better way of running the economy. Capitalism, historically, is about enterprise and the capital needed to grow that enterprise. What we’re trying to do is create an economy where capital and enterprise meet not just to benefit a few shareholders, but to benefit society as a whole. Our goal is to have every company create value for all stakeholders — like corporate workers and community members — not just shareholders.</p><h2>“I assumed the best way make a difference was to run for office.”</h2><p>What did you want to be when you were young?</p><p>By the time I was in fourth or fifth grade, I wanted to be an elected official or a policymaker. My grandfather Ruby, whom I was close to, read The New York Times every day from front to back and engaged me in conversation about policy and social justice from an early age. I assumed the best way make a difference was to run for office.</p><p>Who or what inspired you to go into your field?</p><p>A series of relationships and mentors have helped guide me, including my parents and my grandparents. I spent time in college working on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the elder Basil Brave Heart was a spiritual and moral center.</p><p>But it was former Congressman David Skaggs who really set me on my path. After I interned in his office, I asked if I could return to work for him after college. He said, “Maybe, but I think not yet.” Instead, he told me to do something out in the world — to see what our economy is all about. Although I had no experience in capital markets at the time, his words set me on that path and away from public policy. And I saw that I could effect change without being a politician.</p><p>Where do you find sources of creativity?</p><p>This is not a creative field — it’s not tech, art or music, but I do think that it requires a lot of creativity to invent what an economy ought to look like. But I’m not a mad genius imagining things and willing them to be true.</p><p>Instead, I find that creativity comes through relationships and community, and through conversation to find the right design.</p><p>What obstacles do you need to overcome?</p><p>We face an enormous challenge in that the economic system, over the last 400 years, was built on extraction, without limits. People have been treated as just another economic input, rather than as humans.</p><p>Jay and Bart had the experience of building a business that cared about their employees, while I was on Wall Street in private equity in the belly of the beast. I loved the work, but I saw the industry transformed to focus on how quickly you could leverage something up and sell it with very little interest on the underlying business or the humans involved. As the three of us talked about the problems we saw, we thought that there had to be a better way of running capitalism to benefit society and not just a few shareholders.</p><h2>“What we’re trying to do is create an economy where capital and enterprise meet not just to benefit a few shareholders, but to benefit society as a whole.”</h2><p>How do you define success?</p><p>As I rose up in private equity, the financial rewards never felt like success. And in the end that made it hard to stay in the field.</p><p>Instead, in my work at B Lab, success is any sign of progress toward an inclusive and regenerative economy that is both meaningful and long-lasting. And 13 years into our work, there are real signs of success: New laws that enable businesses to operate as if people and the planet mattered as much as profit, and moves by groups like the Business Roundtable in August. But we still need to tell corporate leaders that they need to walk the walk for change.</p><p>In my personal life, success is defined mostly by whether I have relationships that are bringing me — and other people — joy.</p><p>What challenges do you face?</p><p>We still need to address shareholder primacy as a mind-set and a legal impediment. And we are asking governments what else they can do and trying to form a broader coalition of organizations to address this. And we are working with multinational companies to encourage more to become B Corps — they have big bullhorns and are really important to our work.</p><p>And we are also mindful that while we are trying to build a more inclusive economy, that to do so means we need a more inclusive community in business. It’s a shift that will take some time, but it’s one in which we need to play a role.</p><h2>“I’m not a mad genius imagining things and willing them to be true.”</h2><p>How does technology interact with your profession?</p><p>Technology is having an enormous impact on business. Whether it’s automation, outsourcing or the growth of the gig economy, or issues like privacy and the ownership of data, technology is dramatically changing the nature of work. And these are issues to think about if business is to have a positive impact on our economy.</p><p>At B Lab, we’re dealing with the impact of technology in our standards, which we revise every three years. Recently, we’ve changed our definitions as they related to the people who support a company. We used to call them employees, but now we refer to them as workers because large percentages aren’t actually employed by the company. By just asking about employees, we’re missing a large percentage of the work force, including contractors and those working in the supply chain. We need to make sure to ask about those who may be on the margins — the vulnerable workers in the economy.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:51:32', '2019-10-17 20:51:32', 'working-to-benefit-society-not-just-companies'),

Her entire 30-year career at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has focused on vehicles that very few women drive.</p><p>The automotive sector has been making strides in recent years to hire more women in leadership positions but it\'s still an industry where men dominate the decision-making. Krear said she had few female engineering peers in the beginning and \"in most cases I was the only woman at the table.\"</p><p>Being the only woman, however, never put the brakes on her career.</p><p>\"This industry has so much opportunity,\" she said. \"The automobile is the No. 1 consumer good. I wanted to work in the auto industry from day one.\"</p><p>Krear, a board member of FCA\'s Women\'s Alliance, a group that helps employees network and find mentors, has seen the number of female employees at FCA steadily grow in the last decade. She estimates that women make up 30% to 40% of the Gladiator team, including La Shirl Turner, who, as head of advanced color and materials design at FCA, was responsible for the exterior paint, wheels, trim, headliner and carpet on the Gladiator. Ram also employed women in key roles, Krear noted.</p><p>\"We had a pretty strong representation of women,\" she said. \"The work dynamic is just amazing. You feel more like a family. You get to know each other ... we make the best decisions for the product.\"</p><p>Recruiting female engineers</p><p>Karen Horting, executive director and CEO of the Society of Women Engineers, told ABC News the Big 3 automakers in the U.S. -- General Motors, Ford and FCA -- have \"definitely made a commitment to recruit women.\"</p><p>Still, fewer than one in five engineers in automotive are female, Horting said. Women account for 27% of the domestic auto manufacturing workforce compared to about 47% of the overall labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p><p>\"Women have the same skills as men,\" Horting said. \"I hear from women engineers that they love being able to contribute to an industry that impacts so many. It\'s good business for all automakers to hire women.\"</p><p>Having more women role models in automotive would encourage young females to apply for jobs traditionally held by men, according to Cindy Schipani, a business law professor at the University of Michigan.</p><p>\"There has been a shortage of engineers and companies have needed to step up recruiting efforts across the board,\" she told ABC News by email. \"There are studies that point to the importance of diversity for improving decision-making. In addition, businesses in general, are becoming more aware of issues of unconscious bias in recruitment and promotion decisions and may be trying to address these issues. Awareness is the first step. I also think that Mary Barra\'s leadership at GM, with her background in engineering, serves as a terrific role model for women engineers, and may influence the career choices of some women.\"</p><p>A recent \"Women at the Wheel\" study conducted by Deloitte and Automotive News found the percentage of women who aspire to senior executive positions in automotive has fallen from 82% in 2015 to 41% in 2018. Moreover, the study said the industry is perceived as doing the least to attract and retain women.</p><p>Krear said her years of hard work and determination, including going back to school for her Executive MBA as a full-time mother and engineer, have rubbed off on her two adult children. Her 22-year-old daughter now plans to pursue a career in another male-centered profession: investment banking. With 30 years of experience and two master\'s degrees, Krear can prepare her daughter for what to expect as a minority in the workplace.</p><p>\"When you\'re the only woman in the room, you kind of second-guess yourself,\" she said. \"I would tell her to be herself. When you are comfortable, people around you are comfortable as well. Don\'t be afraid to offer input, and when you do -- be confident and trust yourself. If you don\'t nobody else will.\"</p><p>Women are \'big influence\'</p><p>Hiring more female Jeep employees is important, Krear said. But so is getting women to become lifelong fans of the brand.</p><p>Krear, who drives a truck every day, engineered the Gladiator so it would appeal to men and women equally.</p><p>\"We also spent a lot of time tuning the ride so it rides like an SUV,\" she said. \"The back seat folds down and it\'s all one-hand operation. You could be holding your baby, or a cup of coffee, or your puppy in your left hand and you can get to everything behind the rear seat.\"</p><p>She went on, \"The women are just in love with it. They see it and think it\'s the coolest thing on the road. They want to know what it is.\"</p><p>According to a 2014 analysis by consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, women influence 80% of the car buying decisions. Jim Morrison, head of the Jeep brand, said management constantly solicits the opinions of female customers.</p><p>\"We spend a lot of time paying attention to ladies,\" he told ABC News. \"They\'re a big influence on the purchase and ownership. We make sure we get lots of input from customers.\"</p><p>Jeep sold 16,132 Gladiators in the third-quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 23,384.</p><p>\"Sales have been good,\" said Morrison. \"We\'re still building inventory and we had our best month in August.\"</p><p>Pushing the Gladiator to its limits</p><p>Less than 15% of Jeep owners take their vehicles off-roading, according to Morrison. But Morrison and Krear wanted to prove that the Gladiator -- just like popular Wrangler SUV -- can crush, clobber and dominate any off-road obstacle.</p><p>The Jeep team and a small group of journalists, including this ABC News reporter, set out on the notorious 22-mile Rubicon Trail in September, one of America\'s most ferocious and grueling off-roading courses.</p><p>\"The sounds of scraping might freak some people out but we take our Jeep vehicles to the extreme,\" said Morrison. \"If you\'re not paying attention you\'re stuck or rolling off a cliff.\"</p><p>The Gladiator Rubicons overpowered the massive boulders and rocks that were scattered throughout the unrelenting trek.</p><p>There was screeching (from both the inexperienced journalists and skid plates below the Gladiator\'s belly), intense moments of articulation and occasional body-slams when maneuvering the truck around the rugged terrain.</p><p>Under Krear\'s direction, the 3.6-liter, V-6 engine Gladiator was built to be lightweight, stiff and durable with advanced all-wheel drive systems. It can haul a payload of 1,600 pounds with its five-link suspension system. A front-facing trail camera helps drivers to avoid sticky situations and a longer wheelbase and frame enables better weight distribution.</p><p>\"We wanted the Gladiator to be best in our segment -- an absolute reputable truck,\" Krear said.</p><p>Krear, who skillfully handled the trail in a manual Gladiator, said trucks are part of her DNA. Engineering a sports car? Not in her future.</p><p>\"I love trucks and Jeeps,\" she said. \"It\'s about being able to go anywhere and do anything.\"</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 20:53:28', '2019-10-17 20:53:28', 'amazing-meet-the-woman-behind-jeeps-rugged-boulder-climbing-new-pickup'),

For three successive nights, protests have spiraled into violence, with demonstrators burning half a dozen cars and hundreds of trash cans, causing 1.1-million-euros-worth of damage ($1.2 million) and eventually clashing with police. Fires also raged in other Catalan towns.</p><p>Authorities said that nearly 100 people were injured, almost half of them police officers. A total of 97 protesters have been arrested since Monday, including four sent to jail while authorities investigate them for public disorder.</p><p>Police said the protesters hurled gasoline bombs, stones, firecrackers and bottles at them. Fireworks hit a police helicopter, although no major damage was caused. Regional and national police responded with foam bullets and batons.

He added that Catalonia had experienced widespread \"material and reputational damage\" caused by \"minority groups who are perfectly organized.\"</p><p>The rioting put the spotlight again on the self-appointed Committees for the Defense of the Republic, or CDRs, and a new shadowy online platform, Tsunami Democratic, that uses encrypted messaging apps to advocate for \"peaceful civil disobedience.\" Tsunami Democratic, whose leaders are not publicly known, was behind the call to storm Barcelona\'s airport on Monday, causing cancellations of some 150 flights and leading to clashes with police late into the night.</p><p>The groups, often following the blueprints of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and elsewhere, have become popular among technology-savvy young Catalans since the October 2017 banned referendum that eventually led to the separatist leaders\' convictions. During that vote, police used batons and dragged away voters who refused to move from polling stations.</p><p>Most messages spread quickly through the encrypted messaging app Telegram via groups such as \"Aturem Catalunya,\" \'\'Anonymous Catalonia,\" or Tsunami Democratic\'s own channel, which has more than 315,000 followers. They share photos and videos of the protests and spread warnings about police movements.</p><p>Spain has cracked down on the committees, jailing some members as it investigates them for possible terrorism offenses, while Spain\'s Interior Minister said Wednesday that its probe is close to determining who is behind the Tsunami Democratic.</p><p>On Wednesday, a few hundred attended a Barcelona gathering to mark the two years behind bars of Jordi Sánchez, a popular Catalan activist-turned-politician who headed the grassroots pro-independence ANC group. Meanwhile, only blocks away at the city\'s port, the committees attracted thousands responding to social media fliers and posts on Telegram. The protesters threw toilet paper into the air, a metaphor for the fact that there is \"a lot that needs cleaning up.\"</p><p>Support for the groups seems fueled by frustration among many in Catalonia who feel abandoned even by their separatist political leaders who failed to make effective the short-lived independence declaration that followed the 2017 referendum.</p><p>\"If foreigners see us protesting peacefully all the time, they might think that nothing is going on or they might not even notice us,\" said Feliu, a 68-year-old retiree who was joining one of five marches that are peacefully making their way from inland towns to Barcelona.</p><p>The ANC has advocated for \"Freedom marches,\" inspired by those led by Mohandas Gandhi in 1930 and by the 1963 March on Washington organized by African-American civil rights leaders.

If you\'re like a majority of Americans, you\'re guided in part by your wallet.</p><p>More than 7 in 10 U.S. airline passengers (72 say ticket price is a key deciding factor when choosing an airport to fly into or from, according to a 2019 survey commissioned by NerdWallet and conducted online by The Harris Poll among more than 1,800 U.S. adults who have ever flown on an airplane.</p><p>But travel experts suggest you shouldn\'t decide based on ticket price alone. Before locking in a reservation, here are other factors to consider.</p><p>AVAILABILITY OF DIRECT ROUTES</p><p>Compare a direct flight against one with a layover. The latter might save you money, but cost you in comfort and convenience as you squeeze into a puddle-jumper and have to gate-check your carry-on.</p><p>\"Living on the west coast of Michigan, we have a lot of choices of airports,\" says Heather Houtman, a travel adviser and owner of Winsome Travel Design in Holland, Michigan, via email. Airports in Houtman\'s region include Gerald R. Ford International in Grand Rapids, Capital Region International in Lansing, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, and Chicago\'s O\'Hare International and Midway International.</p><p>\"What we consider is availability of direct flights, times of departures and arrivals, and least of all is price.\"</p><p>ON-TIME RECORD</p><p>When you have choices among airports, one may be cheaper or more convenient to fly into — but what will it cost you in time? Some airports are notorious for late departures, \"ground stops\" that delay all arrivals, or both. The Bureau of Transportation lets you search on-time statistics by flight number.</p><p>For example, the 9:15 p.m. JetBlue flight from New York\'s LaGuardia Airport to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, might be more convenient to your hotel than flights from LaGuardia to, say, Palm Beach International. But per Bureau of Transportation statistics, among flights with delayed arrivals of more than 30 minutes, that LaGuardia-to-Fort-Lauderdale route was the most consistently delayed flight in the U.S. in June 2019.</p><p>SECURITY CHECKPOINT WAIT TIMES</p><p>If you\'re on a tight schedule, the amount of time you\'ll spend standing in security lines counts. Fortunately, there are tools that can help.</p><p>Say you\'re flying out of Chicago and have a choice between O\'Hare and Midway. You can download the Transportation Security Administration\'s MyTSA app and see which one tends to have the shorter security line wait time for your travel window.</p><p>Keep in mind, too, that having Global Entry or TSA Precheck can help expedite the airport security process.</p><p>GETTING TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT</p><p>Even if you\'re saving upfront on your ticket, factor in the expense and ease of getting from the airport to where you need to be. An airport a bit farther from the city center might cost less to fly to, but you may end up spending more time and money to get to your final destination.</p><p>When traveling to Washington, D.C., \"I will always fly into Reagan over Dulles,\" says Melissa Terrio, who travels several months of the year for her job as director of graduate recruiting and admission at the Foisie Business School in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"By the time you get from Dulles into D.C., it\'s more expensive in the end because there\'s limited public transportation ... and a taxi can be cost-prohibitive.\"</p><p>THE STRESS FACTOR</p><p>When you have a choice between arriving at a bustling hub or a smaller regional airport, the latter option can be less stressful, says Melita Siemak, a travel adviser and owner of Pacific Heights Travel in Manhattan Beach, Calif ornia, via email.</p><p>Large airports can be overwhelming. Gates can be farther apart, lines can be longer, crowds can be bigger and louder.</p><p>\"Sometimes smaller makes it easier to get through the airport,\" Siemak says.</p><p>SECOND CHANCES</p><p>What if your flight gets canceled or overbooked? It can be less of a problem if your departure airport has multiple options to get you to your destination in time for a business meeting or a bedtime story.</p><p>Someone trying to get to Cleveland after missing their flight from New York\'s Kennedy Airport might be out of luck, as there may be only a handful of direct flights a day between JFK and Cleveland Hopkins International. But if you miss your flight from New York\'s LaGuardia, there often are more nonstop options to that Cleveland airport, increasing your chances of catching a later plane.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

The Education and Labor committee voted along party lines to advance the bill, and the Energy and Commerce panel was deliberating. Ways and Means also held a hearing. Democrats and Republicans say Pelosi is moving quickly to get the bill ready for a floor vote.</p><p>\"These are jaw-dropping savings,\" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who chairs the health subcommittee of Energy and Commerce. \"This is legislation that is going to make a true, tangible difference in the lives of the American people.\"</p><p>Eshoo said the money could be used to provide dental, vision and hearing benefits for Medicare recipients or could be reinvested in drug research at the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>But at another hearing before Ways and Means, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, caustically dubbed the Pelosi bill the \"Fewer Cures for Patients Act.\" Brady said the budget office finding that one consequence could be fewer drug approvals should be a stop sign for lawmakers.</p><p>Although supporters of the legislation note that the CBO said only a small share of new drugs would be affected, Brady said, \"One cure lost is one cure too many.\"</p><p>The legislation from Pelosi, D-Calif., would authorize Medicare to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs — including insulin — using lower prices paid in other economically advanced countries as the reference point. The budget office says that could result in price cuts of 40% to 55% for pharmacy drugs. The bill would allow private insurance plans to also get Medicare\'s price.</p><p>As a hammer to force companies to negotiate, Pelosi would impose steep sales taxes on the medications at issue. Overall, budget analysts estimated the legislation would cut industry revenues by $500 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years. The CBO says those numbers are preliminary.</p><p>Congressional Republicans are broadly opposed to allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, so the legislation has no chance in the Senate unless Trump gets behind it. As a candidate, Trump called for Medicare negotiations, and Pelosi\'s office has been in communication with top White House officials for months. Congressional Republicans say negotiations are best left to insurers that administer Medicare\'s prescription drug benefit.</p><p>If Trump\'s anger over the Pelosi-initiated impeachment probe sinks the effort, lawmakers of both parties would face voters next year with nothing to show on a top consumer issue. The White House had no comment on the budget estimates.</p><p>A poll this week found broad public support for Medicare drug negotiations, as well as for Pelosi\'s idea of taxing companies that won\'t come to the table. But the survey from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation also showed that support can shift to opposition if people are told there could be limits on research or access to new medications.</p><p>A leading policy expert on drug costs said Pelosi has framed a crucial question: What\'s the right balance between fostering innovation and keeping drugs affordable?</p><p>\"The savings are so large that you can\'t pretend for a second we don\'t have to look at this,\" said Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at New York\'s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p><p>CBO hasn\'t said what kinds of new drugs could be kept off the market — whether they would be copycat medications or if life-changing medications would be affected, too.</p><p>\"We reduce average prices by 55%, and we will lose some new drugs — between 2.5% and 5% — that\'s the estimate,\" said Bach. \"Some people will say we want everything.\"</p><p>Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, head of the center-right American Action Forum public policy group, said he\'s not so sure that only drugs of marginal value will be sacrificed.</p><p>He said he\'s not worried about major drug companies but rather about smaller research-oriented outfits that have to raise considerable sums from private investors to keep going.

Instead, Crosthwaite said the company would defer to the decision of the Food and Drug Administration, which has set a deadline of next May for manufacturers to submit their vaping products for federal review.</p><p>Under the agency\'s standards, only vaping products that represent a net benefit to public health are supposed to remain on the market.</p><p>If the company can show that its products are less harmful than cigarettes and can help adults switch, they could presumably return. Many experts, however, doubt the company will be able to win the FDA endorsement, given the popularity of Juul among underage users</p><p>Underage vaping has reached epidemic levels, according to health officials. In the latest government survey, more than 1 in 4 high school students reported using e-cigarettes in the previous month despite federal law banning sales to those under 18.</p><p>While Juul agreed to stop lobbying against a flavor ban, other industry players haven\'t. The Vapor Technology Association is launching a national marketing campaign aimed at stopping the White House plan by using the slogan, \"I vape, I vote.\"</p><p>A poll released Thursday shows that Americans narrowly favor banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, although younger adults are more likely to oppose the idea.</p><p>Banning flavors is supported by 52% of adults of all ages and opposed by 44%, according to the poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

The margin of sampling error for all respondents was plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p><p>In a separate public health crisis, the federal government is investigating more than 1,300 cases of lung damage linked to vaping, some of them fatal.

Crucially, the Northern Irish party that supports Johnson\'s minority government also stood opposed, leaving it uncertain if the prime minister would get the votes he needs to ratify the agreement.</p><p>After an intense week of talks and with only two weeks to go until Britain\'s scheduled departure on Oct. 31, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker broke the tension with a tweet Thursday morning: \"We have one! It\'s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment.\"</p><p>The deal found a way to avoid a hard border between Ireland, an EU member, and the U.K.\'s Northern Ireland. It crucially also lays a path for Britain\'s orderly departure, which Britons approved in a referendum more than three years ago.</p><p>European leaders unanimously endorsed the proposal on Thursday, formally sending it to the British Parliament, which will consider it in a special session Saturday.</p><p>Johnson, who has lost almost every important vote in Parliament since taking office in July, said he was confident he would succeed where his predecessor did not — Theresa May\'s proposal was voted down three times in Parliament.</p><p>\"This is a great deal for our country. I also believe it\'s a very good deal for our friends in the EU,\" Johnson told reporters in Brussels. \"There is a very good case for MPs across the House of Commons to express the democratic will of the people as we have pledged many times to do and to get Brexit done.\"</p><p>But it was shaping up to be a struggle. All the major opposition parties condemned the agreement, and Johnson\'s key ally, Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party, also said its lawmakers would oppose it.</p><p>\"It seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\'s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said.</p><p>Many opposition lawmakers want to oppose the deal and then seek to delay Brexit until there has been an election, a new referendum or new negotiations. Last month Parliament passed a law ordering the government to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline if Parliament doesn\'t approve a deal by Saturday.</p><p>But Juncker appeared to rule out any new postponement, leaving British lawmakers with a simple choice: deal, no deal or revoke Brexit.</p><p>\"If we have a deal, we have a deal, and there is no need for a prolongation,\" he said. The ultimate decision on any extension, though, does not rest with Juncker. It\'s a decision for the other 27 EU countries.</p><p>Johnson\'s 10 Downing Street office put it even more succinctly with the mantra: \"New deal, no deal — but no delay.\"</p><p>Johnson began his career as a Brussels-based journalist spinning exaggerated tales of EU excess for British readers, and as a politician helped lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU, but that acrimony was nowhere in sight on Thursday.</p><p>Instead, relief was palpable in Brussels as leaders happily mingled in the summit room of the Europa building, which often been ground zero for European crises. Johnson cheerily saluted French President Emmanuel Macron, who responded with the heartiest of handshakes.</p><p>The jubilation soon turned bittersweet, with EU leaders bemoaning the impending loss of a major member state — a military, economic and diplomatic juggernaut that had joined 46 years ago.</p><p>\"In my heart I will always be a Remainer and I hope that our British friends decide to return one day,\" European Council President Donald Tusk said, using the nickname for people who supported keeping Britain in the EU. \"Our door will always be open.\"</p><p>EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he and his fellow Frenchmen would not forget \"Britain\'s solidarity during the darkest hours,\" a reference to their alliance during World War II.</p><p>The pound hit a five-month high against the U.S. dollar on news of a Brexit deal, then sank back as traders heard Johnson\'s Northern Irish allies were still unhappy with the way the deal handles the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland — the only land border between the U.K. and the bloc and long one of the thorniest issues of any exit.</p><p>The new proposal is broadly similar to the 585-page withdrawal agreement that May hammered out, with the only major changes on the Irish border issue.</p><p>The agreement must also still be ratified by the European Parliament.</p><p>That could happen as early as next week when it meets in Strasbourg, though the legislature\'s chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, told The Associated Press that the body will take its full time to carefully examine and approve any divorce deal, even if that spills past Oct. 31. He said EU lawmakers will only start their work once the U.K. Parliament has passed the deal.</p><p>The deal agreed Thursday will be legally binding if approved — but it doesn\'t cover the all nitty gritty of future relations between the U.K. and the EU. It merely lays out the terms for withdrawal, while leaving the details of trade and other issues to future negotiations. The only issues that leaders felt they couldn\'t put off and had to hammer out ahead of a U.K. exit were the thorniest ones: how to address the Irish land border and the rights of British and EU citizens living in each other\'s territories.</p><p>The deal gives the two sides a grace period to work out other details by keeping relations as they are until the end of December 2020.</p><p>The key hurdle was finding a way to keep goods and people flowing freely across the Irish border after Brexit. That invisible, open border has underpinned the region\'s peace accord and allowed the economies of both Ireland and Northern Ireland to grow.</p><p>Johnson insists that all of the U.K. — including Northern Ireland — must leave the bloc\'s customs union, which would seem to make border checks and tariffs inevitable.</p><p>Barnier said the deal \"squares this circle\" by leaving Northern Ireland inside the EU single market for goods — so border checks are not needed on the land border on the island of Ireland. Instead, customs checks will be carried out and tariffs levied on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain that are destined for the EU.</p><p>That effectively means a customs border in the Irish Sea between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain — something the British government long said it would not allow and something Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party vehemently opposes.</p><p>\"We have come to the conclusion — sadly come to the conclusion — that we won\'t be able to support the prime minister\'s deal,\" said DUP leader Arlene Foster.</p><p>———</p><p>Follow AP\'s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Lorne Cook and Sam Petrequin in Brussels and Mike Corder in London also contributed.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:11:29', '2019-10-17 21:11:29', 'high-anxiety-in-brussels-will-brexit-deal-be-clinched'),

In return, the contract allows GM to proceed with factory closures in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore.</p><p>Details were posted Thursday on the United Auto Workers website as factory level union officials met to decide if they\'ll approve the deal. Workers went on strike Sept. 16, crippling the company\'s U.S. production and costing it an estimated $2 billion.</p><p>The Detroit Hamtramck plant, which GM wanted to close, will stay open and a new electric pickup truck will be built there. Meanwhile, the Lordstown area will get a new battery factory that is expected to employ 1,000 workers. In addition, a company called Lordstown Motors could also set up a factory that would initially employ 400 workers. But neither of those would come close to the shuttered Lordstown assembly plant, which two years ago employed 4,500 people making the Chevrolet Cruze compact car.</p><p>The deal shortens the eight years it takes for new hires to reach full wages and gives temporary workers a full-time job after three years of continuous work. Workers hired after 2007 who are paid a lower wage rate will hit the top wage of $32.32 per hour in four years or less. The deal also provides a $60,000 early retirement incentive for up to 2,000 eligible workers.</p><p>The tentative agreement between GM and the UAW now will be used as a template for talks with GM\'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn\'t clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.</p><p>The strike at GM immediately brought the company\'s U.S. factories to a halt, and within a week, started to hamper production in Mexico and Canada. Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That\'s too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds.</p><p>GM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\'s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\'s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.</p><p>Amid that uncertainty, GM workers wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health — earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter — they wanted a bigger share.</p><p>The union\'s bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement.

As a result, Johnson will be reliant on the support of those from other parties and independent lawmakers to get over the line. That\'s even more difficult now that Johnson\'s allies in Parliament, the 10 members of Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party, have rejected his deal as bad for the region.</p><p>Arguably Johnson has a better chance of securing a majority than his predecessor, Theresa May, did, as many pro-Brexit Conservative Party members appear ready to back him.</p><p>One of the main reasons why May saw her own withdrawal agreement with the EU voted down by legislators on three separate occasions earlier this year — by 58 votes the last time — was because members of the so-called European Research Group within the Conservative Party voted against.

Around 20 of them, mainly representing pro-Brexit parts of the country, have previously indicated a desire to back a deal in order to honor the June 2016 Brexit referendum result.</p><p>Most Labour members will vote against after the party\'s leader Jeremy Corbyn expressed his disapproval.

The result is they fetch premium prices, protect cultural heritage - and are shielded from competitors.</p><p>U.S.-made Parmesan cheese, for example, is not allowed access to the European market as a copycat of the traditional Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano - a barrier that the U.S. milk producers lobby are pressuring to bring down.</p><p>Italian President Sergio Mattarella sought to impress on U.S. President Donald Trump during a White House Visit on Wednesday that the taxes may result in a \"mere race between tariffs\" after the WTO decides Europe\'s case later this year over U.S. subsidies to Boeing.

Spanish olives, for example, have been singled out, while those from Italy and Greece have been left alone.</p><p>That has created additional anxieties, with Spanish olive producers worried that U.S. buyers will turn to buying from Italian companies instead.</p><p>The U.S. tariffs appeared to be selectively chosen to hit premium items that well-heeled U.S. consumers could continue to afford even at higher prices - and not sectors that would more directly correlate to the unfair subsidies for Airbus, which could put a damper on the U.S. economy, said Gianmarco Ottaviano, an economics professor at Milan\'s Bocconi University.</p><p>\"We don\'t see a lot of tariffs on things that Italy is exporting a lot, like machinery. The reason is that this is probably more useful than Parmesan cheese to the U.S. economy,\" he said. \"You want to punish, but at the same time, you don\'t want to shoot yourself in the foot.\"</p><p>A tariff is essentially a tax on importers and for small U.S. retailers , they come at a bad time ahead of the holiday season.</p><p>WTO-authorized sanctions are supposed to prod the trade combatants into resolving their differences. But Trump, who has labeled himself \"Tariff Man,\" has enthusiastically slapped import taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and on thousands of Chinese products in separate disputes and has bragged that the levies raise revenue for the U.S. government.</p><p>\"There should be negotiations,\" said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington and a former U.S. trade official. \"Unfortunately, it seems like we\'ve got a president who\'s tariff happy. That makes it harder to get those kinds of negotiations and remedies in place.\"</p><p>U.S. wine retailers, distributors and importers already expect some customers to seek alternatives from countries whose products aren\'t being taxed. And any signs that customers are balking at higher prices will force retailers to absorb their increased costs.</p><p>The vice president of Italy\'s main industrial lobby, Lisa Ferrarini, said that European producers could in the longer-term shift exports away from the U.S. market. But director of the Spanish food and beverage industry director disputes that logic, saying, \"there is no alternative to the American market.\"</p><p>European producers and diplomats were still pressing for a last-minute change of heart using all available channels, from social media to diplomacy.</p><p>Italy\'s agriculture minister, Teresa Bellanova, tweeted a photo to Trump promoting grapes and Italian Parmesan as a healthy snack, and the president of the Emilia Romagna region, where much of the cheese is produced, has launched a social media campaign in support of the product.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, rebuffed Mattarella\'s in-person overtures, arguing that Europe \"has taken tremendous advantage of the United States.\"</p><p>France\'s finance and economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, will make another attempt to soften the tariff blow when he meets with U.S. trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Thursday.

It\'s all a waste now,\" said apple farmer Mohammad Shafi, pointing to a heap of rotten apples thrown into a pit in Wuyan, a small village 37 miles (60 kms) east of Srinagar, the region\'s main city.</p><p>Kashmir\'s pristine mountainous landscapes, ski resorts, lake houseboats and orchards have long made it a tourist attraction. But an armed rebellion that began 30 years ago in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir rages on.</p><p>In August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Hindu nationalist-led government stripped Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status and imposed a strict crackdown, sending in tens of thousands more troops, detaining thousands of people and blocking mobile phones and internet services.</p><p>More than two months later, the region remains under a communications blockade. Authorities have restored landline services and some cellphones, but not internet, making it difficult to reach traders outside the region to conduct business.</p><p>Apple growers were expecting a bumper crop this year. Now, they say, losses are in the millions of dollars and the business might suffer its worst year since the beginning of the insurgency that has resulted in almost 70,000 deaths.</p><p>\"It all started in August. We haven\'t recovered since,\" Shafi said.</p><p>On Wednesday, police said suspected militants shot dead an apple trader and injured another in a late-night attack in southern Shopian. The same day, a migrant laborer who worked at a brick kiln was also shot dead, police said.</p><p>That followed the arrests Tuesday of two militants suspected of shooting dead a truck driver near an apple orchard where he had collected 800 boxes of fruit.</p><p>On Sept. 6, unknown gunmen fired at a fruit trader in northern Sopore, injuring him and four members of his family.</p><p>So, the orchards lie empty of harvesters, as overripe fruit ripens and thuds to the ground.</p><p>The apple trade, worth $1.6 billion in exports in 2017, accounts for nearly a fifth of Kashmir\'s economy and provides livelihoods for 3.3 million. This year, less than 10% of the harvested apples had left the region by Oct. 6.</p><p>\"It will take us years to recover from this shock,\" said Basheer Ahmad Basheer, who heads an apple growers\' union in Srinagar.</p><p>The authorities set up four wholesale markets to help support the industry, but as of Oct. 6 those markets had only managed to buy $300,000 worth of apples out of what was expected to be a crop worth close to $1.9 billion this year.</p><p>\"We have only managed to dispatch two trucks from this place to outside Kashmir,\" said Anshul Mittal, a government official at a wholesale market set up in Parimpora, Srinagar.</p><p>Many of the more than one dozen officials sent to help out at the market said the effort was failing, partly because truckers are refusing to take the risk of shipping the apples. None wanted to be named as they feared retribution from higher-ups.</p><p>The worst-hit region is southern Kashmir, where dense apple orchards stretch through hundreds of villages.</p><p>Shafi\'s orchard in Wuyan usually produces almost 10,000 boxes of apples per year. He says he\'s only sold 1,000 boxes this year. Half of the rest of the harvest had to be thrown out because the apples were bruised from falling off the trees, he said.</p><p>Growers like Shafi often rely on loans to pay for labor, fertilizer and other costs.</p><p>\"A few days ago a friend came to me asking for the repayment of loans. I wept and begged in front of him as I have no money to give back to him,\" Shafi said.</p><p>The despair trickles down to unskilled workers like 22-year-old Sheeraz Ahman, who was counting on 45 days of work to earn more than $400 to help support his family.</p><p>So far, he\'s only gotten five days of work.</p><p>\"We are in a desperate situation,\" Ahmad said.</p><p>Still, there are fewer laborers looking for work than usual: many left the region at the same time tourists were advised to get out in August.</p><p>One young apple picker, who asked not to be named out of fear of the authorities, said he preferred to be hungry rather than trapped in an army camp.</p><p>The army has denied allegations of arrests and torture.</p><p>But rumors of such tactics have alarmed those who usually would be working in the orchards.</p><p>So have the shootings.</p><p>Police blamed a local rebel for the Sept. 6 shooting and claimed insurgents were intimidating traders and truck drivers.</p><p>Many farmers told The Associated Press such threats were keeping them away from the orchards, regardless of who was brandishing weapons.</p><p>Beyond the crippling of this bedrock of the Kashmir economy is the symbolic importance of its apples.</p><p>Some working in the industry said they preferred to let the apples rot to foil Indian efforts to show the situation has returned to normal.</p><p>The government\'s crackdown, by stifling communications and provoking the insurgents, has made that impossible, said Aabid Gulzar, a 19-year-old English literature student who also works as a laborer at an apple orchard to help support his family of six.</p><p>\"They (India) can blame anybody they want to but who created this rapidly deteriorating situation in first place?\" he asked.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:29:29', '2019-10-17 21:29:29', 'apple-economy-latest-casualty-in-strife-torn-kashmir'),

But as she faces growing scrutiny, the Massachusetts senator is opening herself to criticism that she\'s just another politician dodging the tough questions.</p><p>She is in a bind because of her persistent refusal during two straight presidential debates to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the universal health insurance plan known as \"Medicare for All.\"</p><p>By not acknowledging taxes would almost certainly increase for a wide range of income earners, Warren avoids becoming a caricature of a Democrat itching to raise them. But she also threatens to undermine the image she\'s fostered of a plainspoken former professor ready to tackle any issue in her quest to protect the middle class from the excesses of corporations and the wealthy.</p><p>Warren\'s progressive rival, Bernie Sanders, has said middle-class taxes would have to rise to pay for Medicare for All. Other White House hopefuls said Wednesday that Warren should be just as direct.</p><p>\"Look, I\'m not picking on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous,\" said former Vice President Joe Biden, currently Warren\'s chief competitor for the Democratic nomination. Warren \"is going to have to tell the truth\" or face questions about her willingness \"to be candid and honest with the American people.\"</p><p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Warren \"needs to come forward and say\" how she\'d pay for a new health insurance system.</p><p>\"I\'m sure she will eventually,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, echoed that thought from the campaign trail in Ames, Iowa.</p><p>\"Everybody should be prepared to defend their plans,\" he said Wednesday. \"It\'s serving us well to be very clear about how our plan works and to lay out the fact that it\'s paid for.\"</p><p>Warren argues pundits are missing the point by focusing on taxes instead of the bottom-line cost that Americans pay for their health care. She insists that eliminating premiums and co-pays under Medicare for All would lower overall costs for all but wealthy Americans.</p><p>Her top supporters say she should keep pressing that message.</p><p>\"Democratic voters are actually very appreciative that, on the substance, she wants to bring down health care costs, and, on the politics, she\'s not taking the bait and giving Republicans and the insurance industry the TV ad moment that they want to deceive voters,\" said Adam Green, a liberal activist and close Warren ally.</p><p>Still, the lack of specificity on paying for Medicare for All is tricky since Warren famously is the candidate who \"has a plan\" for everything and proudly sweats even the smallest, wonkiest details.</p><p>On health care, she says that she\'s \"with Bernie,\" referring to the Vermont senator who authored the Medicare for All legislation in Congress. Warren\'s campaign says that no one yet knows Medicare for All\'s final price tag — but that Warren is still \"reviewing the revenue options\" previously suggested by Sanders and that she has been very consistent and clear in saying she\'ll pay for it by adhering to the principles of lowering overall costs for middle-class families and raising them for rich people and major corporations.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidates traditionally go to great lengths to avoid the idea that their party is tax happy. But being blunt about raising taxes is not necessarily an election loser, as long as their effect is targeted.</p><p>President Barack Obama was reelected in 2012 following a pledge to raise taxes on top earners and did so by allowing previous tax cuts on the wealthy to expire. And Warren\'s promises of a 2% wealth tax on households with a net worth of more than $50 million elicits chants of \"2 cents!\" at her rallies, bolstering her reputation as an economic populist.</p><p>The generous benefits Warren is promising — surpassing other countries with government-run health care — would require tax increases of a historic magnitude to guarantee cradle-to-grave care for every U.S. resident, however. And that will make it harder to finance the program with surgically targeted tax increases on corporations and the wealthy.</p><p>A study released Wednesday from the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Institute estimated the government would need $2.7 trillion in additional revenues if Medicare for All were fully implemented next year. That\'s more than half the current federal budget, and Washington is already borrowing heavily to meet its obligations.</p><p>\"It\'s a huge tax increase,\" said Urban Institute health economist John Holahan. \"If you just lay it on a small group of people, how do you get those numbers?\"</p><p>Targeting income brackets also means necessarily picking winners and losers — and a person\'s health status at any given time could determine what side of the ledger they wind up on.</p><p>\"The success or failure of major health reform plans always hinges on who would win and who would lose, and we don\'t have the detail for the Medicare for All plans to judge that,\" said Larry Levitt, a senior health policy expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>Support for Medicare for All has fallen slightly since the beginning of the year, even as Warren and Sanders have championed it. An October poll by the Kaiser Foundation found 51% of Americans favor the plan, while 73% said they support a public option that would compete with private health insurance.</p><p>Among Democrats, support for a public option has outpaced support for Medicare for All, 85% to 71%. A public option is backed by more moderate Democratic hopefuls, including Biden and Buttigieg.</p><p>Traditionally, the U.S. has paid for social insurance programs with broad-based taxes. Medicare\'s financing includes a payroll tax, money from the Treasury\'s general fund and premiums paid by seniors. Sanders has laid out some options for Medicare for All, including a payroll tax on employers, a \"premium\" tax on households making more than $29,000 for a family of four and higher taxes on the wealthy — which is further than Warren has gone in explaining where the funding will come from.</p><p>Releasing a more detailed health care proposal of her own could at least start to address these issues for Warren. But her advisers have long maintained that, while she may eventually do so, it isn\'t imperative.</p><p>\"What resonates is not an academic version of her plan — it\'s her personal story of struggle connecting with the real-world impact of her plan on everyday families,\" Green said. \"Medicare for All is about the principles, not the micro-mechanisms for putting it altogether.\"</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Emily Swanson in Washington, Hunter Woodall in Keene, N.H., Thomas Beaumont in Ames, Iowa, and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:32:28', '2019-10-17 21:32:28', 'warren-candidate-with-the-answers-dodges-tax-hike-question');

Analysts say the costs to GM will hit around $2 billion.</p><p>Workers, on the other hand, lost north of $3,000 each on average, the difference between their base wages and $250 per week in strike pay from the union.</p><p>\"It\'s nice to see there\'s a deal, but without knowing the details I\'m a little skeptical because we don\'t know the highlights or the lowlights,\" said worker Nick Kuhlman, who was among the strikers huddled around a burn barrel on a blustery, gray Toledo afternoon.</p><p>\"I just hope it gets done,\" said Toledo worker Mark Nichols, who thought the strike would last only a week or two and was ready to get back to work because his savings are running low.</p><p>GM apparently was able to close three of four factories that it wanted to shutter to get rid of excess capacity in slow-selling cars and components. The Detroit-Hamtramck plant will get a new electric pickup truck and stay open, but factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore are to be closed. The Lordstown area will get an electric vehicle battery factory, but it won\'t have nearly as many workers as the assembly plant that for years made compact GM cars.</p><p>The deal now will be used as a template for talks with GM\'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn\'t clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.</p><p>Schwartz said depending on the contents, the GM contract could influence wages and benefits in other industries. But he said foreign automakers with U.S. factories, mainly in the South, will give modest pay raises regardless of the GM contract, and shouldn\'t be affected much.</p><p>Clarence Trinity, a worker at GM\'s engine and transmission plant in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan, said the deal sounds good, \"but I have to see it in writing or hear from the leaders.\"</p><p>Trinity said he can\'t figure out why it took 31 days for the strike to end. \"I don\'t understand what General Motors was expecting to get out of us. Maybe they didn\'t expect us to strike. Maybe they didn\'t expect us to strike this long.\"</p><p>If all of the committees bless the deal, it\'s likely to take several days for GM to get its factories restarted.</p><p>Matt Himes, a worker at the GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, heard news of the deal in Ohio, where he\'s trying to help his wife sell their house after the Lordstown GM plant where he used to work was shuttered.</p><p>He hopes good news keeps coming. If they can sell their house, his wife can finally move south with him.</p><p>\"I\'m proud that we stuck our ground and everybody stuck together,\" Himes said of the union workers during a phone interview. \"And I\'m relieved that hopefully it worked out, got us a good contract and we can move on and get back to work making cars like we should be.\"</p><p>Wall Street investors liked news that the strike could end. GM shares jumped 2.6% just after the news broke, but eased back to close up 1% at $36.65.</p><p>GM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\'s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\'s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.</p><p>Amid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health — earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter — they wanted a bigger share.</p><p>The union\'s bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement. Union leaders from factories nationwide will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.</p><p>In past years, it\'s taken a minimum of three or four days and as long as several weeks for the national ratification vote.</p><p>This time around — with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials — many union members don\'t trust the leadership. But they\'re also tired of striking and may return before they vote on the deal themselves.</p><p>The strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., and also took down factories in Canada and Mexico. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007, and the longest since a 54-day strike in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that also halted most of GM\'s production.</p><p>————</p><p>Associated Press writers Mike Householder in Detroit, John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio, and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:34:07', '2019-10-17 21:34:07', 'workers-celebrate-deal-with-gm-show-union-power-in-industry'),

He had said the VA was the \"the most corrupt\" and \"probably the most incompetently run\" Cabinet department. Democrats and major veterans\' groups oppose \"privatization\" and say VA facilities are best-suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>At the meeting, Trump asked whether \"we should begin to close the VAs,\" according to the book. Legislation prohibited that, so Shulkin responded that the VA was working with Congress to set up a system-wide review to address underperforming facilities, whether by fixing or closing.</p><p>\"But this takes time,\" Shulkin said.</p><p>Trump exclaimed, \"So let\'s just do an executive order!\"</p><p>\"This is a legislative issue,\" Shulkin said.</p><p>Trump then offered, \"Can\'t we just declare a national emergency?\"</p><p>At that point, according to the book, Trump\'s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, chimed in, \"Yes. We\'re still in a war, so we could.\"</p><p>Shulkin told the AP that ultimately he dissuaded Trump from pursuing that route, persuading him to sign executive orders for changes with wider support, such as expanded telehealth options for veterans.</p><p>The 2017 Oval Office conversation is illustrative of Trump\'s early intentions toward the VA and remains significant as he pushes for reelection, citing in part his accomplishments in expanding Choice and boosting mental health care for veterans. Veterans as a group have largely backed Trump throughout his presidency, despite lingering questions about his intentions about preserving the VA.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email: \"While the former VA secretary chooses to profit off his time in office and share outlandish claims about his private conversations with the President, President Trump remains focused on ensuring veterans receive the care they have earned through their incredible sacrifice for our Nation.\"</p><p>Shulkin, a former Obama administration official, was fired by Trump in March 2018 amid an ethics scandal over a trip to Europe that Shulkin took with his wife that mixed business and pleasure, as well as mounting rebellion by political appointees in his agency. His book, \"It Shouldn\'t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country,\" will be released next Tuesday.</p><p>He said the expansion of the Veterans Choice program under his successor, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie , has put the agency at risk \"as never before.\" Shulkin cited political forces inside and outside the administration that are more interested in putting \"companies with profits\" over the care of veterans, and suggested that only new leadership — at the department, probably at the White House, too — could save VA.</p><p>Yet, as VA secretary, Shulkin pushed a plan to give veterans wider access to doctors outside the VA medical system. Veterans should get \"more choice in the say of their care,\" he told the House Veterans\' Affairs Committee in October 2017. \"Nobody should feel trapped in the VA system.\"</p><p>Shulkin says Trump\'s plans regarding \"privatization\" were still an open question when Shulkin was fired.</p><p>A few weeks before, Shulkin said he was explaining to Trump in an Oval Office meeting why an aggressive expansion of private care for veterans could be very costly for the government, at more than $50 billion. Trump decided to call Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator who was once considered for the VA secretary job , to ask his opinion. \"We can find the money from within the VA,\" Hegseth told Trump, according to the book, suggesting significant cuts to VA care.</p><p>\"Much of my narrative deals with the factions pushing me to simply close the VA or at least large parts of it that weren\'t working well,\" Shulkin wrote. \"But I didn\'t see how shutting down a system specifically designed to care for veterans could be in the veterans\' best interests.\"</p><p>The legislation that Trump ultimately signed last year gives veterans more freedom to see doctors outside the VA in an effort to cut wait times, paving the way for new rules that Shulkin says will \"lead to the rapid dismantling of the current VA system.\" Recent studies have actually found that veterans got into a VA facility for an appointment faster on average and received better care than if they went to a private facility, raising questions about the value of steering veterans to the private sector if it results in inferior care.</p><p>The legislation expanding the Choice program includes a provision for a presidentially appointed commission to be set up in 2021, after voters elected the next president, to compile a list of VA facilities nationwide to be closed or reconfigured. If the president approves, closures would then begin unless Congress voted down the entire list, giving lawmakers no input on individual facilities to be added or removed. Wilkie in recent months has been urging Congress to pass legislation to allow the commission to start before the November 2020 election, citing market assessments the VA will have completed by then to judge which facilities to keep. Wilkie insists he\'s opposed to privatizing VA.</p><p>\"I am convinced that the path now chosen, if allowed to continue, will leave veterans with fewer options, a severely weakened VA, and a private health care system not designed to meet the complex requirements of high-need veterans,\" Shulkin wrote.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:35:24', '2019-10-17 21:35:24', 'book-trump-mulled-order-to-close-parts-of-va-health-system'),

Delegations from other countries, including Mexico, have visited Canada as they explore the possibility of rewriting their own marijuana laws.</p><p>But officials promised legalization would be a process, not an event, and they weren\'t wrong. Kinks abound, from what many consider wasteful packaging requirements and uneven quality to the slow pace of licensing stores and growers across most of the country.</p><p>Canada allowed provinces to shape their own laws within a federal framework, including setting the minimum age and deciding whether to distribute through state-run or private retail outlets. Some have done better than others.</p><p>The result: There now are more than 560 licensed stores across Canada, but more than half are in Alberta, the fourth-largest province.</p><p>Ontario and Quebec, which together make up two-thirds of Canada\'s population, have only about 45 shops between them. In Newfoundland, Canada\'s easternmost province, pot shop owner Tom Clarke said he\'s about to hit $1.5 million in sales but isn\'t making any money, thanks to rules that limit him to just an 8% commission.</p><p>Online sales, designed to ensure far-flung communities can access the market even if they don\'t have a licensed shop, have been underwhelming, at least partly because consumers are reluctant to pay with a credit card if that transaction might come to the attention of U.S.-based banks or border guards, said Megan McCrae, board chair of the Cannabis Council of Canada industry group.</p><p>Nowhere are the challenges of legalization more pronounced than British Columbia, which has had a flourishing cannabis culture since U.S. military draft-dodgers settled there during the Vietnam War era. They grew what became known as \"B.C. Bud,\" high quality marijuana cherished by American consumers.</p><p>In Vancouver, which has 2.2 million residents and is Canada\'s third-largest city, there was tacit approval of marijuana even before legalization. Though storefront distribution of medical marijuana never was allowed by law, about 100 dispensaries operated in the city before legalization arrived.</p><p>Around the province, authorities have visited 165 illegal dispensaries in the past year and warned them to get licensed or shut down. Despite some raids, the government has been reluctant to close them all before more licensed shops open.</p><p>Licensing has been glacial, though, thanks to a change in power in the provincial government and cities being slow to approve zoning and other requirements, partly because the province has no tax-revenue-sharing agreement with local jurisdictions. Regulatory hurdles have also made it tough for B.C.\'s many small growers to be licensed; instead, production is dominated by large corporations churning out pot by the ton from massive greenhouses.</p><p>Regulators hoped to have 250 legal shops operating in British Columbia by now; instead, they have only about 80 private stores and seven government-run shops. Through July, legal sales in B.C. were a meager $25 million. Alberta, with a smaller population, hit $145 million.</p><p>\"Everybody still uses their neighbors and their backyards,\" said Susan Chappelle of the British Columbia Independent Cannabis Association.</p><p>Nevertheless, the legal market has fans. Vancouver resident Sarah Frank, who used to grow her own marijuana plants, loves that she can walk into a clean, welcoming, legal shop and walk out with a few grams of her favorite cannabis, actor Seth Rogen\'s Houseplant Sativa brand.</p><p>\"You don\'t feel like a criminal,\" said Frank, 41. \"I have friends who can\'t travel to the States because 20 years ago they got busted with a joint.\"</p><p>Some who want to get into the legal business are still waiting. With legalization looming last year, Chris Clay shut down his gray-market pot shop on Vancouver Island for what he thought would be a few months, eager to apply for a license and reopen. A year later, he\'s still waiting.</p><p>Some of his workers went on unemployment and eventually found jobs elsewhere. He\'s barely avoided bankruptcy, and though local officials have finally started handling applications, he says it will likely be another three to six months before he\'s back in business.</p><p>\"It\'s very frustrating,\" he said. \"Tourists have been driving up and down the island all summer, saying, \'Where can we go? Where can we go?\'\"</p><p>For Mike Babins, who runs Evergreen Cannabis, the Vancouver shop where Frank buys her Seth Rogen-brand weed, it\'s just fine that legalization is developing slowly.</p><p>\"Everyone\'s watching us,\" he said. \"If anything goes wrong here, we\'re screwing it up for the whole world.\"</p><p>———</p><p>Gillies reported from Toronto.

Netflix\'s most popular plan in the U.S. costs $13 per month.</p><p>Netflix is counting on the unique lineup of award-winning TV shows and movies that it has amass since expanding into original programming six years ago to help it retain its competitive edge and attract more subscribers.</p><p>It has taken advantage of its head start in video streaming to track the viewing interests 158 million subscribers around the world, giving it valuable insights into the kind of programming that is most likely to appeal to wide swaths of its audience.</p><p>That knowledge, in theory, will help Netflix and choose which TV shows and movies to back in the future as it bids for programming against the likes of Apple, Disney and existing rivals such as Amazon and AT&T\'s HBO.</p><p>Even if Netflix keeps picking winners, some budget-conscious subscribers may be tempted to abandon its service and be content with the entertainment options being dangling by Apple and Disney.</p><p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings acknowledged Wednesday that a U.S. price increase imposed earlier this year is causing some current subscribers to cancel the service and perhaps causing some prospective customers to shy away.</p><p>\"There\'s a little more sensitivity, we are starting to see a little touch of that,\" Hastings said during a discussion about the third quarter. \"What we have to do is just really focus on the service quality, make us must-have.\"</p><p>Apple is trying to make its new streaming service even more tempting by offering it for a year to anyone who buys an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer. And Disney already is heavily promoting on Twitter its forthcoming service by highlighting that it will feature classic films such as \"Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs\" and \"The Lion King.\"</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said he is expecting Netflix to lose some of its appeal. He thinks the company could lose about 24 million subscribers, or about 15% of its customers, during the next 18 months.</p><p>As more competitors take aim at Netflix, some of them are also pulling their programming from the service. Disney is yanking its films from Netflix beginning next year. Beloved TV series \"The Office\" and \"Friends\' will disappear from the service in 2020 and 2021 in separate decisions made by NBC and AT&T.</p><p>The losses of those popular shows may hurt Netflix even more than the competing streaming services from Apple and Disney, said Michael Pachter, another Wedbush Securities analyst.</p><p>\"Netflix is going to lose 50% of its most viewed hours during the next two years,\" Pachter said. \"As that starts to happen, subscribers are going to start to notice and some may start looking elsewhere.\"</p><p>Netflix has another problem: It has been borrowing billions of dollars to pay for most of its programming. With its debt load already standing at $12 billion and still likely to climb, Netflix probably can\'t afford to cut its prices without risking bankruptcy, Pachter said.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:40:13', '2019-10-17 21:40:13', 'netflix-heads-into-showdown-with-slowing-subscriber-growth'),

But with Britain\'s Oct. 31 departure date looming and just hours to go before the EU leaders\' summit, hopes were increasingly turning toward getting a broad political commitment, with the full legal details to be hammered out later. That could mean another EU summit on Brexit before the end of the month.</p><p>Negotiators were locked inside EU headquarters with few details leaking out. Wild movements in the British pound Wednesday underscored the uncertainty over what, if anything, might finally be decided.</p><p>The focus of recent talks has been the thorniest component of a deal: how goods and people will flow across the land border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K.</p><p>So far, all plans to keep an open and near-invisible border between the two have hit a brick wall of opposition from Johnson\'s key Northern Irish ally, the Democratic Unionist Party. Leaders from the party met several times with the British prime minister Wednesday as he tried to win their support. Without it, any Brexit deal is likely to be rejected by Britain\'s Parliament — which has already voted down prospective deals three times.</p><p>Johnson told Conservative Party lawmakers on Wednesday that he believed a deal was close.</p><p>Legislator Bim Afolami quoted the prime minister as saying \"the summit is in sight, but it is shrouded in cloud. But we can get there.\"</p><p>Northern Ireland is not the only issue. The eventual withdrawal agreement will be a legal treaty that also lays out other aspects of the U.K.\'s departure — including issues like the divorce bill Britain must pay to leave and the rights of U.K. and EU citizens living in each other\'s territories. It will set up a transition period in which relations would remain as they are now at least until the end of 2020, to give people and businesses time to adjust to new rules.</p><p>But the agreement will likely leave many questions about the future unanswered, and Britain\'s departure is sure to be followed by years of negotiations on trade and other issues.</p><p>Even if a deal is inked this week, moves in the British Parliament could still mean another delay to Britain\'s planned Oct. 31 departure.</p><p>U.K. lawmakers are determined to push for another delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit that economists say could hurt the economies of both the U.K. and the EU. They have passed a law ordering Johnson\'s government to seek to delay the departure if a deal isn\'t in place by Saturday.</p><p>Johnson has both promised to obey Parliament\'s order and vowed to leave the bloc on Oct. 31, deal or no deal.</p><p>Parliament has also repeatedly rejected previous attempts at a Brexit deal. With the need to get Parliament\'s approval looming over negotiations, EU leaders are seeking reassurances from Johnson during this week\'s summit that he has the political weight to push any new deal through the House of Commons, which is due to meet Saturday for its first weekend session in almost 40 years.</p><p>The Brexit talks plodded ahead Wednesday, further delaying preparations for the EU summit. Since the weekend, negotiators have been locked in long sessions on how to deal with detailed customs, value-added tax and regulatory issues under British proposals to keep goods and people flowing freely across the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p><p>\"Talks have been constructive, but there still remains a number of significant issues to resolve,\" EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said after being briefed by Barnier.</p><p>Beyond the questions of disrupting daily life, an open Irish border underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.</p><p>The big question is how far Johnson\'s government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the EU\'s customs union — something that would require checks on goods passing between the U.K. and the EU.</p><p>An alternative is to have checks in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. But Northern Ireland\'s DUP, the party that props up Johnson\'s minority Conservative government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.</p><p>Pro-Brexit Conservative British lawmaker David Davis said success in passing a Brexit deal rests on the stance of the DUP.</p><p>\"If the DUP says, \'This is intolerable to us\' that will be quite important,\" he said.</p><p>DUP leader Arlene Foster said the party had not yet consented to a deal.

While 52% of U.K. voters backed leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, a majority in Northern Ireland — 56% — voted to remain in the bloc.

In June, Twitter said world leaders\' tweets that violate its rules but have a clear public-interest value might get a warning label. The label would provide context on the violation and let people to click through to see the tweet if they want to.</p><p>While Twitter said in June that it will not use its algorithms to \"elevate\" or otherwise promote tweets that have a warning label, it now says it also won\'t let people retweet or comment on them. People will still be able to \"quote tweet\" the material. Quote tweeting lets users add their own message above someone else\'s tweet and post it on their own timeline. This nuance shows the fine line Twitter is trying to walk with its policy — it wants to promote free expression and allow people to comment on controversial tweets, but it doesn\'t want to promote them on their own, without context.</p><p>With all that, the company has yet to slap a tweet with a warning label since putting its policy into effect. So is it all for show? Below are some questions and answers about Twitter\'s policy.</p><p>———</p><p>WHAT DID TWITTER DO?</p><p>On Tuesday, Twitter said it\'ll take action on any account — world leader or not — that makes clear and direct threats of violence against a person, depending on the context. What is this context? A world leader interacting directly with another public figure, or commenting on political and foreign policy issues, would \"likely not result in enforcement,\" Twitter said.</p><p>\"Foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules,\" the blog post reads. For instance, Trump has threatened Iran on Twitter, prompting his critics to call for his removal from the service. But based on Twitter\'s policy, that doesn\'t count as a violation.</p><p>But other things, such as promoting terrorism, posting someone\'s private information such as an address or phone number, promoting self-harm, engaging in child sexual exploitation or sharing intimate photos of someone without their consent could all get a world leader kicked off Twitter.</p><p>———</p><p>WHY DID TWITTER DO THIS?</p><p>Twitter wouldn\'t say what prompted Tuesday\'s blog post. But there\'s been growing pressure from Democrats, including presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris , to remove Trump from Twitter because of what they see as bullying and abuse. In a public letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Harris listed offending tweets from Trump such as one on Sept. 29 when he wrote that he wants Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff arrested and questioned for \"treason.\"</p><p>\"No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter\'s user agreement, not even the President of the United States,\" the letter reads.</p><p>But not only has Twitter not removed Trump, the tweets in question are without any warning label. Even with Tuesday\'s explanation, it is not entirely clear what tweets from a world leader could get one. Since Schiff is also a public figure, Twitter could say it doesn\'t count even if he is targeted by the president.</p><p>———</p><p>WHAT DO CRITICS THINK?</p><p>Twitter has critics on all sides. Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center\'s Intelligence Project who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda online, called the policy statement a step in the right direction. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \"that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.\"</p><p>If Trump\'s tweets were to get a warning label, however, this could fuel his supporters\' ire toward Twitter. The president routinely complains, without evidence, that social media sites are biased against him and other conservatives.</p><p>———</p><p>OTHER COMPANIES?</p><p>Neither Facebook nor Google (or YouTube) have specific policies exempting world leaders from their rules. But Trump\'s use of Twitter is unique as it is unprecedented, so other social media companies have not felt the same pressure to enact such a policy. All the big social media companies generally ban direct threats of violence, supporting terrorism, as well as hate speech and abuse. But enforcement can be spotty on all counts, and context matters — even in the president\'s case, many of the tweets that offend his critics could fall in a gray area.</p><p>That said, Facebook\'s recently announced policy of not fact-checking politicians\' posts or advertisements has drawn fire from critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic presidential candidate.

Click here to submit your problem online. Letters are edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Dear Sahib:</p><p>First, one thing you left out of your letter: You’re a high school student! You were dealing with trying to fix the car (seven times!), plus researching your state’s Lemon Law and staying on top of your case – all while keeping up with homework, applying for college and playing on your school’s tennis team.</p><p>That’s a lot to handle. You had done so much work and were so organized, the ABC News Fixer was more than happy to give this a little push over the finish line.</p><p>You told us the first sign of trouble came one day as you drove on the highway about six months after getting the car. As you approached your exit, the shifter lost power and the “check engine” light came on. The car stalled, but luckily you were already at the ramp, so you coasted down and rolled to a stop. The car was stuck in neutral and you couldn’t turn it off because the shifter wouldn’t shift into park.</p><p>After some stressful attempts, you finally got the car into park and turned it off.</p><p>Later, when the dealership looked at it, they couldn’t find the cause. You kept driving – and it happened again. And again. When you hit a pothole…when you stopped in a fast-food drive-thru.</p><p>You took it in seven times at two different dealerships, but the problem kept happening. Luckily, you kept good records. And you looked into the California Lemon Law, which protects consumers who have persistent problems with new vehicles.</p><p>Your dad filed the case with the manufacturer – his name was on the sales contract – but you took charge of the phone calls. That became your new hobby, calling the manufacturer to try to get an update on your case.</p><p>You told The Fixer you think many consumers would have gotten tired and given up after six months of repair attempts at two different dealerships and another two months of dealing with the manufacturer.</p><p>But you kept at it.</p><p>We reviewed your documents and got in touch with Fiat Chrysler, which owns the Dodge brand, asking about the delay.</p><p>Shortly after, you got some good news – they were offering your choice of a replacement vehicle or the monetary value of your car. You opted for the money.</p><p>We asked Fiat Chrysler about the long wait, and a company spokesman said that’s just the way it is — it’s a complex process, with the title needing to clear from owner to manufacturer.</p><p>The company said that in the end, they were glad they could take care of this “in the interest of customer satisfaction.”</p><p>You were smart to stay organized and keep good records of all the problems you had with the car.</p><p>Lemon laws vary from state to state, but are generally for new cars that have persistent, substantial issues.</p><p>In your home state of California, a car is a lemon if, within 18 months or 18,000 miles, there have been two or more attempts to repair a serious problem that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, or four or more attempts to repair the same issue, or if the car has been in the shop for more than 30 days.</p><p>Here are some more tips for success in a Lemon Law case: • Act quickly. Check the deadline to file in your state. You don’t want to lose out because you waited too long to file. And be sure to contact the manufacturer, not the dealer, to file your lemon case. • Keep excellent records. Write down the purpose and date of each repair and note how long your car was in the shop each time. • If you win, you will get a replacement vehicle, or the cash value minus the mileage. • Don’t expect to get reimbursement for after-market items. If you lose your case, you can still go to court.</p><p>Note: Lemon laws don’t apply to used cars. That’s why used car buyers need to be especially careful. Here are some great tips on buying a used car.</p><p>And if you’re wondering where lemons end up, they can be repaired and resold, but their registration must disclose that they were once a “lemon buy-back” vehicle.</p><p>-The ABC News Fixer</p><p>Do you have a consumer problem?

But the agreement he\'s struck with the European Union would erect significant trade barriers for companies operating in the United Kingdom, reduce growth and leave the country poorer.</p><div>The deal must still be approved by the UK parliament, which will convene Saturday for a special session. To secure its passage, Johnson must win over lawmakers who voted three times against a previous Brexit accord negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May.</div><div>Johnson will struggle to make the case that his deal is better than May\'s when it comes to the economy. Her agreement would have kept the United Kingdom in close alignment the European Union, despite it leaving the bloc\'s unified market and customs union. Johnson has abandoned that goal, and instead wants Britain to have more control over its regulations and global trade policy at the expense of easy access to the EU market of about 450 million people.</div><div>\"Flexibility comes at a cost,\" said Jonathan Portes, a professor at King\'s College, London, and senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, a think tank. \"The fact is, economically, there is no doubt that the gains from being in the EU customs union outweigh any potential free trade deals with another country.\"</div><div>While Johnson\'s deal would be better for the economy than crashing out of the European Union without arrangements to protect trade, Britain faces a future where many of the benefits of decades of integration with the European Union are unwound. EU membership helped Britain attract scores of foreign companies, including the biggest American banks and Japanese carmakers, who used the country as their base in Europe. About 46% of UK exports are shipped to EU markets.</div><div>The way the British economy works would change significantly if Johnson\'s deal is approved.</div><div>In practical terms, his agreement would result in new barriers including onerous customs checks at the border with the EU. And if the United Kingdom chooses to diverge from EU regulations — perhaps so it can strike trade deals with the United States and other countries — manufacturers in Britain might have to make two versions of every product or lose European customers. The UK services sector, which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, would also face new barriers. Banks have already moved some activities from London to EU cities.</div><div>\"Frictionless EU trade and regulatory alignment is vital for UK prosperity and jobs,\" the Confederation of British Industry said in a statement, adding that the deal is \"inadequate\" on services and that big questions remain on whether a free trade deal of sufficient depth can be negotiated with the EU before transitional arrangements expire.</div><div>Johnson\'s Brexit deal would mean significant economic pain. An analysis of his approach published recently by UK in a Changing Europe, found that new trade barriers would reduce national income per person by 2.5% after 10 years, compared to remaining in the European Union. That translates to lost production of £800 ($1,030) for every UK citizen, more than twice the estimated hit under May\'s plan.</div><div>Factor in a 10% reduction in trade and productivity losses caused by new barriers, and the outlook is even more dire. The hit to national income increases to 6.4% under Johnson\'s deal, or £2,000 ($2,575) per person, compared to 4.9% under May\'s agreement, according to the analysis.</div><div>Business groups reacted to Johnson\'s deal with caution on Thursday. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said in a statement that \"businesses need a chance to analyze precisely what the terms of this agreement would mean for all aspects of their operations.\"</div><div>\"Let\'s not forget, we\'ve been here before. There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future,\" he added.</div><div>More than three years of uncertainty over future trade policy has caused many UK companies to put investment on hold, and resolving the Brexit question would produce some immediate economic relief. According to Capital Economics, a surge in investment as deferred projects are revived would help boost growth next year by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5%.</div><div>But the structural changes to the UK economy caused by Johnson\'s deal would diminish the country\'s economic prospects over the longer run. The UK government modeled a range of Brexit scenarios in late 2018, each of which showed the UK economy would be worse off outside the European Union.</div><div>\"This is even worse for the economy than Theresa May\'s deal,\" Hilary Benn, a member of the opposition Labour Party, told the BBC on Thursday. \"It\'s not in the interest of the economy, jobs, investment and the future of our communities.\"</div><p></p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 21:49:23', '2019-10-17 21:49:23', 'new-brexit-deal-is-still-bad-for-business-and-the-uk-economy'),

Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.</p><div>Warren, currently the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban fracking \"everywhere.\" And the Massachusetts senator pledged to immediately sign an executive order to stop all new offshore drilling leases. Both steps go further than her main rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.</div><div>Warren\'s aggressive plan for fighting the climate crisis could have profound consequences for the oil and gas industry. Although an outright fracking ban seems unlikely to get through Congress and the courts, such a move would halt America\'s historic shale oil boom in its tracks, drive up gasoline prices, threaten good-paying jobs and make the nation more dependent on foreign oil.</div><div>\"It would vaporize the oil and gas boom in the United States,\" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm that advises energy companies and investors. \"There is palpable concern in the oil and gas industry.\"</div><div>Wall Street analysts are already warning shareholders about the potential hit to the share prices of oil companies, which remain widely held in portfolios despite the climate crisis.</div><div>\"We think the greatest risk to energy companies would occur if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins,\" RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report published on Monday. The firm said it would be \"very bearish\" for a wide range of oil companies, including drillers such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), oilfield service firms and even integrated companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).</div><div>Warren\'s campaign declined to comment. But the candidate has defended her aggressive stance by arguing the world doesn\'t have the luxury of playing it safe.</div><div>\"Taking bold action to confront the climate crisis is as important — and as urgent — as anything else the next president will face. We cannot wait,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post last month.</div><div>The best-case scenario for the oil industry could be the reelection of President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic who has actively supported the fossil fuel industry by slashing environmental regulations and promoting energy exports.</div><div>Democrats have taken a much more skeptical approach towards Big Oil than Trump as they pledge to tackle climate change. The leading candidates have called for ending fossil fuel subsidies.</div><div>Besides Warren, Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have also pushed to ban fracking, the controversial drilling technique that involves shooting water, sand and other compounds underground to release trapped oil and gas. Fracking has sparked concerns of contaminated drinking water, methane emissions and even earthquakes.</div><div>That\'s why environmental groups strongly support a fracking ban.</div><div>\"A clean energy economy built to tackle the climate crisis cannot include fracked gas, which is a bridge to climate disaster,\" Ariel Hayes, national political director at the Sierra Club, said in a statement to CNN Business.</div><div>Biden, on the other hand, has only called for banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters. Biden also wants to pursue a global moratorium on offshore drilling in the Arctic. During Biden\'s time as VP, Congress and President Barack Obama effectively encouraged more fracking by lifting the 40-year ban on oil exports.</div><div>\'Wildly bullish\' for oil prices</div><div>Fracking, which gained popularity in the early 2000s, has made the United States the world\'s leading producer of natural gas and, more recently, the top oil producer. In 2016, fracking accounted for more than two-thirds of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration.</div><div>Driven by the shale revolution, US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade to about 12 million barrels per day. That surge of oil has cushioned the blow from recent events, including oil barrels sidelined by the attack on Saudi Aramco and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</div><div>An outright fracking ban would probably send crude oil prices soaring because the United States produces more oil than any other country on the planet. The world is relying on US oil shale oil as the main source of growth for the next several years.</div><div>\"It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We\'d be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast,\" said McNally, a former energy official under President George W. Bush.</div><div>Oil jobs at risk</div><div>But it wouldn\'t be bullish for the oil industry. That\'s because the fracking ban would probably cause highly leveraged US shale oil producers to go bankrupt, or at least have limited financial firepower to take advantage of high prices.</div><div>\"They will have been regulated out of business,\" McNally said. \"And the US oil companies that remain will get blamed for high oil prices.\"</div><div>A fracking ban could wipe out countless good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry.</div><div>\"You\'d have layoffs, everything from the field hands up to the C-Suite,\" said Jeff Bush, president of oil and gas recruiting firm CSI Recruiting.</div><div>A 2017 study paid for by the American Petroleum Institute found that a fracking ban would cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs and lift household energy spending by $4,500 a year.</div><div>Warren has pledged to create new jobs to help workers who are hurt by the transition to a greener economy.</div><div>\"We will no longer force workers to make the impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,\" Warren wrote in the Medium post.</div><div>A fracking ban might not have a large impact on prices if oil demand weakened because of a rapid shift towards electric vehicles.</div><div>However, most forecasters expect the world\'s appetite for oil will rise for many years, if not decades. And even Warren\'s own energy plan doesn\'t call for 100% zero emissions for new vehicles until 2030.</div><div>That means diminished domestic oil production would likely make America more dependent on foreign crude, undoing its strides toward energy independence.</div><div>\"It\'s not going to reduce consumption,\" said Bush. \"It just means we\'d be buying more oil from overseas. I don\'t think anybody wants that.\"</div><div>An outright fracking ban also would require an act of Congress, according to analysts.</div><div>Such legislation would be unlikely to get through Congress because Republicans are widely expected to maintain control of the Senate. Even if the Senate flipped, moderate Democrats in oil-producing states such as Colorado and New Mexico would face pressure to oppose such a ban.</div><div>\"There is no real clean path towards a fracking ban,\" said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. \"It seems completely unrealistic, close to impossible.\"</div><div>Federal drilling ban could slow oil boom</div><div>Still, Warren could take regulatory and executive actions aimed at discouraging fracking.</div><div>For instance, RBC said Warren would probably be able to ban fracking and all output on federal lands.

Bring it on, the company says.', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/22DE/production/_109262980_whatsubject.jpg', '<p>As the famed and admired early-mover in the high-quality streaming industry, Netflix has built a formidable business worth in the region of $125bn. In the past three months, it added 6.7 million new subscribers, bringing its total userbase to 153 million worldwide.</p><p>But the next three months will prove to be its most challenging yet. Soon, Netflix will be competing with Disney+, HBO Max and Apple TV+ - all companies with enormous brand recognition and a strong desire to take their own slice of streaming’s riches.</p><p>On Wednesday, Netflix wrote to investors to tell them that competition would be a good thing. The rising tide of streaming services would just tempt more people away from “linear TV”, as they term it, and into streaming services.</p><p>“Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players,” the company told investors.</p><p>“For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing.”</p><p>Netflix pointed to the fact that its growth rate in the US and Canada had been almost identical in the past six years, despite only one of those markets - the US - having a significant competitor in Hulu.</p><p>That may be the case, but Netflix’s argument neglects to address what will be different about what it can offer subscribers in the years ahead. Netflix’s back catalogue is in the process of being slowly picked to pieces, with competitors taking back shows and movies that they agreed to put on Netflix at a time when they didn’t have a streaming product of their own.</p><p>In one high-profile example, the era-defining sitcom Friends, which has been a huge hit on Netflix since being added in 2015, will be moving entirely to HBO’s platform in 2020.</p><p>In what was seen as an effort to counteract that loss, Netflix reportedly paid an astronomical half a billion dollars to secure the rights to Seinfeld. Up against Friends, Seinfeld has arguably far less global appeal, and looks rather tired when compared to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David’s Seinfeld spin-off-of-sorts, which will be an HBO Max exclusive.</p><p>Friends and “Curb” are just two examples. Netflix is losing shows hand over fist. British classics, such as The Office, are now on Britbox. The US Office, cited by many Netflix users as great “background noise”, is being taken away, too - for NBC’s new streaming service, Peacock. That’ll launch in April.</p><p>It means Netflix will need to rely even more heavily on its original content. The “Netflix Original” brand is already well-established and highly-respected. Netflix originals took away 27 wins at this year’s Emmys (HBO won 34, Amazon 15).</p><p>“While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalogue titles),” Netflix told investors, “none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.”</p><p>That assertion on quality is to be debated in the pages of the Hollywood press, not here. But what’s inescapable for Netflix is that, despite the critical acclaim, those originals aren’t having the bottom line impact investors expect.</p><p>Even with the return of one of its stand-out originals, Stranger Things, this most recent quarter (three months ending in September) saw Netflix add just 530,000 new subscribers in the US, below Wall Street\'s expectations. In the previous quarter, it lost 126,000 subscribers in the country.</p><p>Its subscriber growth, then, has mostly come from investing in international markets - with 6.26 million paid members added in the last quarter.</p><p>Without a strong back catalogue, Netflix knows it must keep investing in original content to survive, an extremely costly endeavour: analysts have said the company is going to spend around $15bn on new content this year.</p><p>To maintain that kind of investment, it told investors today it was looking to borrow more money, against a backdrop of investors becoming increasingly worried that the return of investment may not be coming, and that with deep-pocketed newcomers muscling in, the price of acquiring new programmes could rise further.</p><p>Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings admitted his company was outbid for Fleabag, which ended up being a co-production between Amazon and the BBC, and arguably the most talked about new show of the past year. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the show’s co-writer and star, has now signed to Amazon exclusively.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple flexed its riches in beating Netflix to securing “The Morning Show”, Jennifer Aniston’s return to TV, where she\'ll appear alongside Reese Witherspoon.

Notably, in March 2018, a machine developed by engineers at MIT managed to solve a cube in just 0.38 seconds.</p><p>What’s significant with OpenAI’s effort is the use of a multi-purpose robot, in this case a human-hand-like design, rather than a machine specifically designed to handle a Rubik’s cube and nothing else.</p><p>“The ability to solve the Rubik’s cube in the real world, on a robot hand, is actually extremely difficult,” said Matthias Plappert, team leader for robotics at OpenAI, speaking to the BBC.</p><p>“You need to very precisely control your fingers, you need to do it for a very long time without kind of messing up in between. and a lot of different things can happen in the process.”</p><p>End of Youtube post by OpenAI</p><p>Mr Plappert hailed the team’s method of gradually injecting complications into the process - simulated hindrances that would force the robot to adapt in order to complete the cube.</p><p>This technique - called automatic domain randomisation (ADR) - was used, the team said, to give the robot consistent, intricate dexterity that can handle changes in the environment that go beyond what a computer could predict and simulate.</p><p>In a demonstration video posted on Tuesday, OpenAI demonstrated how adding difficulty for the robot - such as nudging the cube with a giraffe stuffed toy, or covering the cube with a black sheet - did not necessarily prevent the completion of the cube (though the hand did not have a 100% record, researchers said).</p><p>While instinctive to humans, handling disruptions or complications, particularly when dealing with holding and manipulating objects, is seen as a grand challenge of robotics - a problem that will need to be solved if advanced robotics are to become commonplace in every home and business.</p><p>“We use human hands for all kinds of things,” said Peter Welinder, also a team leader at OpenAI.</p><p>“We use them to solve Rubik’s cubes, but we also use them for cooking meals. This is one of the reasons we picked the robotic hand, because it promises much more general purpose robots.</p><p>“The big obstacle has been manipulation. So we took the Rubik\'s Cube as an example of really how far can we push manipulation.”</p><p>But, argues Prof Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley, OpenAI’s research should not be overstated, despite being what he described as an impressive act of “showmanship”.</p><p>“The average human isn\'t particularly good at solving Rubik’s cubes,” he told the BBC.</p><p>“So when they see a robot doing it, they say, ‘well, this is better than a human’. But that\'s a little deceptive - because games are not reality.”</p><p>He said OpenAI’s ADR technique was genuine progress, but handling items more complex and unpredictable than a Rubik’s cube will require more research.</p><p>“Will we get to the point where a robot could pick up a deck of cards and shuffle them like a Las Vegas croupier? Or anyone who\'s reasonably good at doing that? That could be 10-20 years off.</p><p>“We’re far from being able to replace kitchen workers who chop up vegetables, or even pick up and you know, do dishwashing. All those are very complex tasks.”</p><p>The BBC has not been able to independently verify the performance of OpenAI’s robot. And, while details were not disputed by the experts the BBC spoke to, OpenAI’s research paper was not peer-reviewed.</p><p>OpenAI was announced in October 2015, co-funded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, start-up specialist Sam Altman and other investors (though Mr Musk is no longer involved). Its goal was to further research in artificial intelligence, with a focus on a technique known as \"reinforcement learning\" - teaching AI with repetitive tasks and \"rewards\" for correct outcomes.

But is there a risk consumers say: \"The new iPhone and Galaxy S10 have three and some others have four. I\'m just going to go with the ones that have more because two doesn\'t sound that great\"?</p><p>Users are very sophisticated now about their phone purchases.</p><p>They study them. They\'ll read the reviews. You\'re going to live with them for two, three or four years.</p><p>A lot of people remember from just a couple of years ago, where all the OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] were touting things such as: \"We have eight cores in our device, so it\'s super-fast.\"</p><p>And then they realised the actual practical mechanics of that were almost none of them was used and it was actually just sort of a marketing specification.</p><p>So, my view is in this market, people don\'t fall for simple numbers anymore. They look for user experiences and Pixel certainly has a brand that\'s known for having an absolutely terrific camera experience.</p><p>The Pixel phone is one of most leaked smartphones. You even tweeted details about its built-in radar in advance. Others go to great lengths to try to keep details of their devices under wraps until launch day. Presumably you don\'t think that matters?</p><p>We definitely wanted to take a bit of a different approach in how we launch and reveal elements of the products. Several months ago, we started to disclose a little bit about how the product looked and some of the core technologies. We wanted to make sure people started to get excited about it and understood a little bit about it.</p><p>Of course, there are other leaks we really would prefer did not happen. And unfortunately that shows a little bit of our adolescence in that we have to make sure we\'re reducing the amount of unintentional information disclosed.</p><p>At some level, we\'re at least happy people care and desire this information. But we do want to try to reduce leaks in the future.</p><p>There\'s been controversy over facial-recognition tests carried out on the phone\'s behalf. To make sure it worked better with dark skin tones, there\'s been reports a contractor targeted homeless people offering them $5 (£4) but didn\'t properly explain what was going on. Can you address that?</p><p>It was very important for us to make sure the face unlock system works for all different kinds of people, genders, races, et cetera.</p><p>And as a consequence, we wanted to make sure we were able to get a large number of data points that allowed us to perfect this model in a fair way. So, we went out and did a lot of research in this area.</p><p>It\'s come to our attention there may be some methods that were not approved, not how we would do business. So, we\'re investigating that. We would never find that acceptable. And so we\'ve suspended any data collection until this is straightened out.</p><p>Just to be clear about what you think is unacceptable. Was it the targeting of homeless people? Was it not explaining exactly what people were testing? Or what?</p><p>All of those allegations would be different than what we would find acceptable.</p><p>But do you still plan to retain the data collected in this way for 18 months?</p><p>I don\'t know that we\'ve discussed the length of time that we\'re holding data. But there have been no changes to the programme with respect to data retention.</p><p>[Note: The Verge reported being briefed about the 18-month limit in July].</p><p>But some people are going to think if the data wasn\'t collected with proper consent, surely you should delete it and start again.</p><p>This is all under investigation. So, I just want to be clear we do not know the full facts of what has happened.</p><p>But if the investigation concludes people didn\'t know what they were consenting to, are you going to delete?</p><p>The best approach here would be to discuss it once we\'ve actually looked into the facts and understood what has happened.</p><p>There\'s a lot of concern about facial recognition. You\'re selling camera-enabled devices that sit in people\'s living rooms, bedrooms, and on their front doors that use the technology. Do you accept reports about what happened with the Pixel tests help undermine confidence in Google and other big technology companies\' use of facial recognition data?</p><p>There\'s a distinction between what\'s being used to train a model for face unlock and facial recognition. There are specific use cases for these different technologies and it\'s very important to examine each one and determine if they\'re being used in a way appropriate for local laws and regulations.</p><p>It is definitely important around the world for what is societally acceptable to be clearly defined in collaboration between tech companies and governments. We want to take a very cautious and thoughtful approach to these technologies.</p><p>They are very important to debate and discuss and then together we have to clarify exactly what to do.</p><p>When Amazon recently unveiled its rival Ring smart cameras many expected them to add facial recognition but it decided not to. Do you think we need politicians to act quickly to set standards because there\'s a growing crisis of confidence?</p><p>It would be great for regulation to be clarified quickly.</p><p>The approach we\'re taking is to try to keep all of this information on devices as much as possible and always keep it private and secure and encrypted.</p><p>There\'s certainly a key responsibility to make sure the user\'s information is protected.</p><p>But everyone would benefit from clarity of standards and regulation. It is a challenging space to navigate.

That has removed 4 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol from the market, angering farmers who rely on the ethanol industry to buy nearly 40% of the corn crop produced to make the renewable fuel additive.</p><p>After months of pressure from farmers, trade groups and lawmakers and governors in farm states, Trump on Oct. 4 announced plans to require oil refineries to replace the ethanol gallons lost through the exemptions.</p><p>Farmers and lawmakers say the EPA had agreed to add waived ethanol back into the fuel supply by calculating the amount waived over a three-year period, which would add about 1.3 billion gallons (2.5 billion imperial gallons) of biofuels back into the nation\'s fuel supply next year. That would ensure that beginning in 2020 the government would comply with the 15 billion gallon (12.5 billion imperial gallon) standard already required under federal law. The deal would not restore the already lost biofuels, a compromise the industry was willing to make in exchange for an EPA promise to change policy going forward.</p><p>On Tuesday, the EPA released the draft rule that would use a three-year average of gallons the Energy Department recommended waiving instead of the actual waived amount, increasing biofuels blending by about 770 million gallons (641 million imperial gallons), about half of what the industry expected.</p><p>\"I thought a deal was a deal.

As a result, men end up holding 62% of manager positions, with women just holding 38%.</p><p>The numbers are worse for women of color: For every 100 entry-level male employees promoted to manager, only 58 black women are and only 68 Latina women are promoted.</p><p>\"For me, the biggest takeaway is that we’ve long thought that the glass ceiling was the problem, that there is this invisible barrier on top of the pipeline that prevents people from rising to leadership,\" LeanIn.org’s co-founder and CEO, Rachel Thomas, told ABC News. \"It\'s really at that first step up into management, that broken rung.\"</p><p>This means \"there\'s fewer women to promote at every subsequent level,\" she added. \"And as a result women can never effectively catch up.\"</p><p>\"Until we fix that broken rung, some women may make some cracks in it, but we’re not going to have enough women coming up behind them to really break that glass ceiling,\" Thomas said.</p><p>Alexis Krivkovich, a senior partner at McKinsey and the co-founder of the annual report said their findings are especially important because \"so much attention has really gone to the glass ceiling, but the largest number of women affected are women at the beginning of their careers.\"</p><p>\"One thing that\'s interesting is how many companies don\'t realize that it\'s an issue,\" Krivkovich added. \"You can\'t solve the problem until you first recognize that it is one.\"</p><p>\"If you don\'t realize that the imbalance is there it\'s really hard to put the attention you need to fix it,\" she said.</p><p>Another issue women face on a day-to-day basis in the workplace that men often don\'t are \"micro-aggressions,\" Krivkovich said.</p><p>\"These are things like having to credential yourself, being mistaken for someone more junior, being asked to take the notes, being challenged or talked over in conversation,\" Krivkovich said.</p><p>\"Women face real headwinds in their advancement,\" Krivkovich said. \"While women demonstrate similar levels of ambition, they have very different day-to-day experiences.\"</p><p>The good news is that the gaze from the C-suite is becoming more female. Since 2015, the representation of women in senior leadership has increased from 17% to 21%, the study found. Meanwhile, 44% of companies have three or more women in their executive level management -- up from 29% in 2015.</p><p>Still, only one in five \"C-suite executives\" is a women, according to the report. And only 1 in 25 \"C-suite executives\" is a woman of color.</p><p>Thomas and Krivkovich urged women not to lose hope, as the data this year holistically has been more encouraging than before.</p><p>At the individual level, Krivkovich said there are two things she always tells women to do as they climb the corporate ladder: Find sponsors in the workplace and stand up for other women.</p><p>\"The first one is to really seek out sponsors and to think broadly about who sponsors, and who really could be a powerful sponsor for you,\" Krivkovich said. \"They don\'t need to be the people you have the most in common with, they don\'t need to be the people you share the most interactions with, they need to be the people who can most help you advance and get ahead.\"</p><p>\"The second one is it can be hard to be your own champion, it can be much easier to be a champion for someone else, so if you are in those meeting where you see those micro-aggressions, where you see someone talked over,\" Krivkovich said. \"Call it out, because being someone else\'s advocate helps brings awareness to everybody.\"</p><p>Thomas said to keep asking for those promotions.</p><p>\"In terms of practical thing that women can do its kind of going outside the bounds of the study itself, it\'s continue to ask, we know that women ask for promotions even if the don\'t get it in the moment, we know that they are more likely to get it in the future,\" Thomas said.</p><p>\"We know that any women, when they ask for specific amount of money, the outcomes are better, so ask for it and be specific,\" she added.</p><p>As for what companies can do? \"One of the biggest things for me is that companies need to treat gender diversity and diversity more broadly as a business priority,\" Thomas said.</p><p>This means set goals or targets, share your metrics, hold senior leaders accountable and reward diversity in the workplace.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 22:15:17', '2019-10-17 22:15:17', 'how-a-broken-rung-in-the-corporate-ladder-stops-women-from-getting-to-the-top'),

Not after aviation regulators deem the Max safe.</p><p>However, airlines are likely to be more flexible in letting passengers change their schedules to avoid flying on a Max, at least for a while.</p><p>\"We will take care of customers who are not comfortable flying on the Max. We will rebook them,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein. The airline won\'t charge those passengers the standard $200 fee for changing a ticket, he said.</p><p>It\'s unclear how long that flexibility will last. Airlines are likely to gauge media coverage and passenger sentiment about the Max. Once the plane recedes from the news and customer confidence grows, airlines could go back to their regular policies around canceling and changing flights.</p><p>Also, while they will be willing to rebook passengers free of charge for a while, that doesn\'t mean that American, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines — the three U.S. carriers that fly the Max — can get you on the next flight. They are under no obligation to find a seat for you on another carrier, or to pay for a hotel room if they don\'t have an available seat until the next day.</p><p>\"If passengers go to the airport and decide not to fly because the flight is going to be operated by a Max, they will not be able to get compensation because it will be their own decision to cancel their trip, it will not be the decision of the airline,\" said Chrystel Erotokritou, who tracks compensation for AirHelp, a company that offers to help passengers with airline-service problems.</p><p>And if the airline offers to put the customer on a flight three days later, \"there isn\'t much the passenger can do,\" Erotokritou said. \"Either they fly with the Max or they cancel their trip, because when the (Max) comes back into service, it will mean that the aviation authorities in the U.S. and the E.U. now consider this aircraft to be perfectly safe.\"</p><p>It is safe to assume that most airline passengers have no idea what model of plane they are booked on, or whether it is a Boeing, an Airbus, or something else. Even after they board the plane.</p><p>American, Southwest and United Airlines, the three U.S. carriers that own Max jets, display the type of plane for every flight on their online schedules.</p><p>However, airlines routinely swap planes when there is a mechanical issue with one, or when an incoming plane is arriving too late.

Airline officials, he said, \"don\'t want customers freaking out after pushback (from the gate) or after takeoff.\"</p><p>American, Southwest and United said they are still finishing details for the return of the Max and how to communicate with customers. When the time comes, they will stress that the plane will have been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Tony Roach, Southwest\'s managing director of customer experience, said the airline will highlight the software upgrades and additional pilot training that will be required before the Max is recertified. United spokesman Frank Benenati said the airline \"will be transparent — and communicate in advance — with our customers who are booked to fly on a Max.\" Feinstein, the American spokesman, said his airline\'s pilots will assure customers that the plane is safe.</p><p>Of course, there is one fail-safe strategy for travelers who are determined to avoid the Boeing plane: \"If you really want to be absolutely sure, you can fly on an airline that doesn\'t have any MAXes,\" said Hudson, the passenger advocate.</p><p>Delta Air Lines is the largest U.S. carrier that has never used the Max, and its CEO said last week Delta benefitted over the summer from the thousands of Max-related cancellations at Southwest, American and United.</p><p>It is still unclear when the Max will fly again. Boeing began working on updating the plane\'s flight software shortly after the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet off the coast of Indonesia. When the plane was grounded after the second crash — an Ethiopian Airlines Max went down near Addis Ababa after takeoff on March 10 — Boeing was optimistic that it could complete the software work in a few weeks.</p><p>That work stretched out over three months, then FAA test pilots found another problem in which computers on the plane could fail.

The Senate hearing is expected to take place on Oct. 29 or after the House hearing on Oct. 30, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the hearing was not yet confirmed.</p><p>The occasion will be the first time that Boeing executives address Congress about the two crashes, as frustration with the company mounts on Capitol Hill and throughout the aviation industry. John Hamilton, the chief engineer of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, is also expected to testify at the House hearing, and may also appear at the Senate hearing.</p><p>The hearings come on the heels of the removal of Mr. Muilenburg’s title as chairman of the Boeing board last week. They are expected to cover everything from the design, certification and marketing of the 737 Max to what happened on the flights that crashed.</p><p>The Max has been grounded since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March, five months after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia. In both crashes, a new automated system on the Max malfunctioned, sending the planes into unrecoverable nose dives.</p><p>Last week, a multiagency task force released a damning report that faulted both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration for their work on the plane. It argued that Boeing had not been forthcoming enough about the new system, known as MCAS, and that the F.A.A. had been unequipped to effectively review the plane.</p><p>This month, it was revealed that a Boeing engineer who worked on the Max filed an internal ethics complaint alleging that the company, in order to minimize costs, rejected a proposed safety system that he felt could have reduced the risks that contributed to the crashes.</p><p>As a result of the prolonged grounding, airlines around the world have canceled thousands of flights and lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Boeing has announced that the grounding will cost the company at least $8 billion.</p><p>Airline executives have grown increasingly frustrated with Boeing.</p><p>“The relationship at the moment is rocky,” Michael O’Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said in an interview last week. “Our view is that Boeing has not addressed this as seriously as was warranted.”</p><p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also called for Boeing to be more forthcoming with information about what led to the crashes and what it is doing to fix the Max.

But federal officials who write airline safety rules have never tested whether smaller seats or tightly packed rows have any effect on evacuation time.</p><p>\"It is a big pet peeve of flyers, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that there is a safety issue,\" said Stacey Zinke-McKee, a medical-research official at the Federal Aviation Administration facility in Oklahoma City where the tests are being conducted.</p><p>Beginning next month, FAA researchers will recruit people from churches, universities and online to come up with a test group similar to the overall U.S. population. Sixty at a time, they will be seated in a simulator laid out like a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, planes commonly used on domestic flights.</p><p>Flight attendants will tell them to get out of the simulator — money will be paid to the first ones off to mimic the sense of panic that occurs in an emergency. Then the seats and rows will be reconfigured, and they will run the tests again — four times with each group of 60 volunteers.</p><p>The researchers will compare tests to see if smaller seats or tighter rows make any difference. A dramatic difference would presumably be reason for FAA to set more generous minimum standards for the airlines to follow. An FAA rulemaking panel will use that data to help set seating standards for airlines, with a decision possible by late next year.</p><p>The average American adult is about 10 pounds (4 1/2 kilograms) heavier than just two decades ago, according to government figures, and airlines are squeezing more passengers into the economy cabin to make more room for high-paying customers in business class. That means tighter rows in the back of the plane.</p><p>Congress last year ordered the FAA to set minimums for seat sizes and the distance between rows.</p><p>Airlines \"are cramming in more and more and more seats, closer and closer together. People are getting bigger,\" House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., told the FAA\'s deputy administrator at a hearing last month. \"I don\'t believe we can meet the standard anymore\" for rapid evacuations.</p><p>The distance from any point on a seat — say, the front of the armrest — and the same spot on the seat in the next row is called pitch, and pitch has been shrinking. A few years ago, the standard was around 34 inches (86 centimeters). Today in the economy cabin of U.S. airlines it is more often around 30 or 31 inches (76 to 79 centimeters), and even tighter on some, including Spirit Airlines.</p><p>Planes are also more crowded. The average flight now is about 85% full — it was 88% on Delta over the summer — and during peak hours every seat is taken.</p><p>Consider also that more passengers carry bags on board, and hundreds of thousands of them bring an emotional-support animal too, and it stands to reason that it will take longer to get everybody out during an emergency.</p><p>Until last year, the FAA resisted calls to set minimum seat and row standards, saying those are matters of passenger comfort, not safety, and it\'s a safety regulator.</p><p>The FAA\'s Deputy Administrator Daniel Elwell agreed at last month\'s congressional hearing that Americans are getting bigger, but he noted that in two recent accidents that destroyed planes — a 2014 Asiana crash in San Francisco that killed three passengers, and a 2018 Aeromexico crash in Durango, Mexico, with no deaths — other passengers were able to evacuate safely.</p><p>\"Survivability today is much, much better,\" he said.</p><p>Since the 1980s, the FAA has taken steps to make evacuations faster. It shortened the distance between emergency exits, it improved access to smaller exits like those over the wings — under pressure from Congress — and it required airlines to judge whether people sitting in exit rows can physically operate the door and help others get out.</p><p>By this time next year, we might know whether minimum seat sizes and legroom will be added to that list.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-17 23:01:09', '2019-10-17 23:01:09', 'faa-to-test-whether-packed-planes-affect-evacuation-time'),

Chicago\'s last major teachers strike in 2012 also has been cited as early inspiration by other unions.</p><p>Now, Chicago teachers are returning to that strategy, aiming to get enforceable school district commitments on smaller class sizes and hiring more support staff. Without those and other commitments, they could begin a strike Thursday that would affect nearly 400,000 students.</p><p>If Chicago does strike, teachers around the country will be closely watching parents\' response to a walkout based on the unions\' \"social justice\" agenda beyond state school funding or teachers\' pay, experts said.</p><p>\"Right now, you\'re hard pressed to find a teacher\'s union that says we only want to bargain for the economic interest of our members,\" said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois labor professor who has studied and written about the 2012 Chicago strike. \"And that\'s why it\'s so hard to get a settlement.\"</p><p>City officials, though, argue contract talks are meant for employee wages and benefits, not questions of staffing or affordable housing.</p><p>Mayor Lori Lightfoot also has said the district\'s offer of a 16% raise over five years for teachers is fair and ensures the district can continue to improve its once dire financial state. The district also has committed to hiring more nurses, social workers and support staff over the next five years but opposes teachers\' demand that be written into their contract.</p><p>After a change in union leadership in 2010, the Chicago teachers union partnered with other community groups working on poverty and crime. Teachers walked out for seven days in 2012, filling Chicago streets and using the bargaining process to force conversations on how those broader issues affected their students.</p><p>The Chicago union wasn\'t the first to use that strategy. But its leadership, including then-President Karen Lewis, acted when teachers nationwide felt unions\' political power and clout had been severely weakened, said John Rogers, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>\"Chicago was a dramatic moment, when this set of ideas coalesced and was enacted and then caught the attention of other unions,\" Rogers said.</p><p>In the years since the 2012 Chicago strike, teachers clad in red have flooded state Capitols in right-to-work states including West Virginia to protest years of cutbacks in school funding.</p><p>The response to those protests reassured teachers of the public\'s support, said Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association.</p><p>\"It is about much more than pay,\" Lee said. \"It\'s about ensuring that every student, not just a select few, has a great public education.\"</p><p>This year, unions in liberal-leaning cities including Denver, Los Angeles and Oakland, California, used contract talks to highlight class sizes and push back on charter schools.</p><p>The approach resulted in some victories: Los Angeles teachers got more money toward reducing class sizes and support staff hires; Denver teachers won changes to the district\'s pay scale; and Oakland\'s teachers got reduced class sizes.</p><p>Those changes still affect a school district\'s bottom line, and education funding in most states was never fully restored after the Great Recession, said Kency Nittler, director of teacher policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality.</p><p>\"Advocating for and winning smaller class sizes means adding teachers, adding additional staff,\" Nettler said. \"So it does feed back into this question of overall compensation from a district or administrator\'s perspective.\"</p><p>Staffing costs, including salary, health care and other benefits, remain districts\' largest expense, said Thomas Bertrand, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards.</p><p>\"When you begin to bargain issues like personnel or class levels, from a management side, you\'re now more hamstrung in managing up to 80% of your budget,\" he said. \"It\'s a delicate balance.\"</p><p>Chicago Public Schools\' finances have improved in recent years with help from higher property taxes and changes to Illinois\' formula for funding schools.</p><p>A Civic Federation review of the district\'s 2020 budget, though, warned that position remains fragile — particularly as the district deals with an underfunded teacher pension fund and declining enrollment.</p><p>Some experts wonder whether emboldened teachers can push parents too far, testing support amid walkouts that scramble thousands of families\' routines. Union leaders, though, argue that\'s unlikely since class sizes and school staffing directly affect students — and parents.</p><p>Chirag Mehta, whose daughter and son attend a magnet school on the city\'s north side, volunteers with a group called Parents 4 Teachers that has been urging parents to contact Lightfoot\'s office every week in support of the teachers union. Mehta, a 48-year-old who works for a national nonprofit, said if Chicago teachers do strike, his kids will come along to the picket lines.</p><p>\"Our school can\'t operate in a vacuum,\" he said. \"We are all in this together and we need to have a mayor, a school system, a school board that sees it the same way.\"</p><p>Tanesha Peeples, a community advocate in Chicago, said she\'s skeptical about public support for a strike this year, particularly among minority community members who worry about their kids\' safety during a walkout.</p><p>\"This can\'t be the go-to every time (the Chicago Teachers Union) feels they don\'t get what they want,\" Peeples said. \"Almost every year, there\'s a strike threat and it throws the community into a frenzy.\"</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 02:21:15', '2019-10-18 02:21:15', 'chicago-teachers-may-test-unions-social-justice-strategy'),

On Oct 4., its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. While the tweet was quickly deleted, the backlash was swift. Within a few days, China\'s state-run broadcasting network ordered a blackout of NBA coverage.

Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. ... So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\'t think so.\" — Minneapolis rally Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\'s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target.</p><p>Trump\'s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\'s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.</p><p>———</p><p>IMPEACHMENT</p><p>TRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>TRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ... I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \'Colluded\' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" — tweet Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That\'s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.</p><p>The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.</p><p>Trump\'s reference to a \"fraudulent speech\" comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president\'s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>Schiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character.\"</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.</p><p>The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.</p><p>———</p><p>SYRIA and TURKEY</p><p>TRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \"I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\'t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged...down.\" — tweets Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: That\'s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.</p><p>Both Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.</p><p>Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\'s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don\'t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.</p><p>Some of Turkey\'s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Thursday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat.</p><p>IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\' self-declared caliphate.</p><p>Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.</p><p>U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \"eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\"</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\'t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.</p><p>The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.</p><p>As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ...including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Most of them came from Europe.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.</p><p>Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.</p><p>Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.</p><p>———</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\'s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \"they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\" — tweet Wednesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.</p><p>Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Monday on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel didn\'t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Monday on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 03:01:26', '2019-10-18 03:01:26', 'ap-fact-check-trumps-shoddy-info-on-syria-impeachment'),

But that could change in mid-December, when the Trump administration has promised to expand import duties on more consumer electronics.</p><p>With the specter of those tariffs, Apple has even more of an incentive to placate China\'s government and avoid provoking Beijing.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario, analysts have estimated retaliatory action from China could cut Apple\'s profit 10% to 20%.

The protests were triggered by a now-abandoned government plan to allow criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China. It has escalated into a broader battle over Beijing\'s efforts to curb the Western-style civil liberties and autonomy promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.</p><p>Beijing\'s criticism of Apple followed government attacks last weekend on the NBA over a tweet by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters. China\'s state TV canceled broadcasts of NBA games.</p><p>One of the police-tracking app\'s users, Hong Kong office worker Acko Wong, 26, scoffed at the suggestion that the app helped give free rein to criminals.</p><p>\"How do you ambush a group of police with equipment and gear like helmets and shields?\" he asked.</p><p>Sharing the skepticism were U.S. politicians like Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who tweeted criticism of the company Thursday: \"Who is really running Apple?

The administration alleges, and many China analysts agree, that these tactics include stealing sensitive technology and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets.</p><p>Trump has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and plans to tax an additional $160 billion of imports on Dec. 15. This would extend U.S. tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States.</p><p>\"The U.S. has made very clear to China what sort of changes they need to make,\" said Stephen Vaughn, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm and former general counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Trump. \"Our president is prepared to make a deal. But it\'s got to be a deal that makes sense to us.\"</p><p>Instead of yielding, China so far has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, notably soybeans and other farm goods that are critically important to Trump supporters in rural America.</p><p>As the trade war has dragged on for 15 months, economic damage has been inflicted on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>The Chinese economy this year is expected to register its slowest growth since 1990.</p><p>In the United States, already struggling manufacturers are suffering from the higher costs that Trump\'s tariffs have imposed on components from China and are paralyzed by uncertainty over whether, when and how the trade hostilities might end.</p><p>A private survey last week found that U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in September, reaching its lowest level since the recession year 2009.</p><p>Larry Kudlow, the White House\'s top economic adviser, sounded an optimistic note as Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prepared for two days of meetings with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He.</p><p>\"Recently some of the statements coming out of Beijing have been a little more positive,\" Kudlow said on the Fox News Channel. \"They\'ve been in the market buying some agriculture commodities from the U.S. — soybeans, pork, and wheat and other things. That\'s a good sign. The mood music — the psychology — seems to be a little better, so let\'s see what they come up with.\"</p><p>But analysts say Beijing is balking at the kind of meaningful policy reforms that might satisfy the administration. Doing so would mean scaling back its bold aspirations to become a technological superpower. It\'s an ambition that China\'s leadership regards as crucial to ensuring prosperity.</p><p>\"There appears to be a fundamental disconnect in the stated goal of the two sides, with China looking for a mini deal and the Trump team talking about settling for only a comprehensive deal,\" Prasad said.</p><p>The administration did forge a mini trade deal of sorts on Monday, when it signed an agreement with Japan that gives American farmers greater access to the Japanese market. But that deal delayed thornier issues, such as trade in autos, for a more comprehensive pact in the future.</p><p>A limited deal with Beijing might involve the United States delaying new tariffs in exchange for China buying more U.S. farm products.</p><p>David Herring, president of the National Pork Producers Council, said hog farmers hope to see China reduce its retaliatory tariffs of 62% on American pork. China is facing a major pork shortage as it combats African swine fever.</p><p>\"China really needs pork,\" Herring said. \"So we\'re optimistic a deal will come about.\"</p><p>The Trump administration and Beijing have previously agreed to short-term cease-fires, delaying tariff increases to buy time for more talks. But Dennis Yang, professor at the University of Virginia\'s Darden School of Business, said he has spoken with Chinese business executives who are bracing for a lengthy battle.</p><p>\"The business community has been prepared for more of a long-term fight,\" Yang said. \"They have had a long time — more than a year — to prepare for the imposition\" of more U.S. tariffs.</p><p>\"The expectation for a great deal is probably gone,\" Yang said. \"It would probably be too ambitious to achieve a deal for China to give up Made in China 2025 or its industrial policies.

With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.</p><p>Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\'s government with troops on the ground in Syria.

We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet on Oct. 7.</p><p>THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat .</p><p>IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\' self-declared caliphate.</p><p>Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.</p><p>U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \"eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\"</p><p>On Sunday, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, said \"it\'s absolutely a given\" that IS will return if U.S. troops leave. \"We may want a war over. We may even declare it over,\" he said on NBC\'s \"Meet the Press,\" but \"if we don\'t keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge.\"</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\'t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.</p><p>The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.</p><p>As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ...including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\" — tweet on Oct. 7.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Most of them came from Europe.\" — Minneapolis rally on Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.</p><p>Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.</p><p>Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.</p><p>———</p><p>UKRAINE</p><p>TRUMP, on Hunter Biden, whose father is former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump political rival: \"Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing, walks out with $1.5 billion. Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. ... So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\'t think so.\" — Minneapolis rally Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\'s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, George Mesires, wrote in an internet post Sunday that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time \"based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.\"</p><p>\"To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\'s board of directors,\" Mesires said, referring to the fund. \"He has not received any return on his investment.\"</p><p>Trump\'s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\'s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.</p><p>Hunter Biden said Sunday that he will step down from the Chinese board at the end of the month as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the presidency.</p><p>———</p><p>IMPEACHMENT</p><p>TRUMP: \"We released a perfect conversation. ...I will say this: Adam Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation. To me, that\'s criminal. What he did is criminal.\" — remarks Friday to reporters.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Congressman Adam Schiff, who when seeing the REAL Ukraine phone call Transcript decided he\'d better make up one of his own.\" — tweet Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Which is it? Did Schiff characterize the phone call before or after the White House memo describing the conversation came out? As far as the timeline goes, Trump was right the second time. But Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said nothing criminal.</p><p>Trump is referring to remarks the California Democrat made at a Sept. 26 committee hearing, when Schiff mocked the president\'s pleas to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. The White House memo of that July 25 call was released one day before.</p><p>During the hearing, Schiff offered an exaggerated performance of that rough transcript. He said his remarks reflected the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character\" and were meant as parody.</p><p>There\'s no question of criminality in what Schiff said. Lawmakers are given wide protections from liability for comments made in the course of Congress under the \"speech or debate\" clause in the Constitution, which seeks to foster political debate.</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics and invents dialogue that he attributes to them; Schiff did similar in his remarks.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>TRUMP, on Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ... I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \'Colluded\' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" — tweet on Oct. 6.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That\'s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.</p><p>The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges. Schiff said his remarks during a committee hearing were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy.</p><p>The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.</p><p>———</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\'s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \"they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\" — tweet Wednesday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"I said, \'By the way, how many federal judgeships do I have?\' They said, \'Sir you have 142.\' ...I said, \'You got to be kidding.\' ...And President Obama was not very good in getting it done.\" — Values Voter summit on Saturday.</p><p>THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.</p><p>Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Oct. 7 on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet on Oct. 7, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel\'s statement relies on an op-ed by conservative commentator Stephen Moore that obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what was claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Oct. 7 on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 04:01:11', '2019-10-18 04:01:11', 'ap-fact-check-trumps-premature-win-on-trade-syria-fiction');

Gavin Newsom criticized Pacific Gas & Electric and ordinary customers complained about the inconveniences caused by the unprecedented blackouts that began Wednesday, with many wondering: Did PG&E go too far in its attempt to ward off more deadly fires? Could the utility have been more targeted in deciding whose electricity was turned off and when?</p><p>PG&E, though, suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77 mph (122 kph) raked the San Francisco Bay Area amid a bout of dry, windy weather.</p><p>\"We have found multiple cases of damage or hazards\" caused by heavy winds, including fallen branches that came in contact with overhead lines, said Sumeet Singh, a vice president for the utility. \"If they were energized, they could\'ve ignited.\"</p><p>Because of the dangerous weather in the forecast, PG&E cut power Wednesday to an estimated 2 million people in an area that spanned the San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country north of San Francisco, the agricultural Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. By Thursday evening, the weather had calmed and the number of customers in the dark was down to about 510,000.</p><p>Inspections and repairs were expected to resume at daybreak and power could be restored Friday to many more customers, Singh said.</p><p>PG&E cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety, aimed at preventing the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people over the past couple of years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.</p><p>CEO Bill Johnson didn\'t respond to Newsom\'s criticisms but promised if future wind events require similar shutoffs, the utility will \"do better\" when it comes to communicating with customers. It\'s unacceptable that its websites crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.</p><p>\"We were not adequately prepared,\" he said.</p><p>The fire danger spread to Southern California on Thursday as raging winds moved down the state. Southern California Edison shut off electricity to about 12,000 people just outside Los Angeles, with wider blackouts possible.</p><p>A blaze ripped through a mobile home park in Calimesa, a city about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of residences. The fire was started when trash being hauled caught fire and the driver dumped the load aside a road, according to Riverside County officials.</p><p>Many of those affected by the outages, which could last as long as five days, were not so sure about the move.</p><p>Sergio Vergara, owner of Stinson Beach Market, situated on scenic Highway 1, on the Pacific Coast just north of San Francisco, operated the store with a propane generator so his customers could have coffee, milk, meat and frozen meals.</p><p>\"I\'m telling you as a plain human being, there is no wind, there is no heat,\" he said. \"We never saw something like this where they just decide to shut off the power, but on the other side — preventing is a good thing, but it\'s creating a lot of frustration.\"</p><p>But in powered-down Oakland, Tianna Pasche said: \"If it saves a life, I\'m not going to complain about it.\"</p><p>Faced with customer anger, PG&E put up barricades around its San Francisco headquarters. A customer threw eggs at a PG&E office in Oroville. And a PG&E truck was hit by a bullet, though authorities could not immediately say whether it was targeted.</p><p>Singh, PG&E\'s vice president of community wildfire safety, urged people to be kind to workers out in the field, saying the employees and contractors \"have families that live in your communities.\"</p><p>\"Let\'s just ensure their safety as well, as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety,\" Singh said.</p><p>The governor said PG&E was to blame for poor management and should have been working on making its power system sturdier and more weatherproof.</p><p>\"It\'s decisions that were not made that is leading to this moment in PG&E history,\" Newsom said. \"This is not from my perspective a climate change story so much as it is a story of greed and mismanagement over the course of decades.\"</p><p>Marybel Batjer, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, blasted PG&E\'s communication and said the situation was unacceptable.</p><p>Experts say the big shut-off will yield important lessons for the next time.</p><p>Deliberate blackouts are likely to become less disruptive as PG&E gets experience managing them and rebuilds sections of the grid so that outages can be more targeted, said Michael Wara, a researcher on energy and climate policy at Stanford University.</p><p>Grids are built and operators are trained to keep the power on at all times, so the company and its employees have little experience with intentionally turning the electricity off in response to rapidly changing weather, he said.</p><p>\"That\'s a skill that has to be learned, and PG&E is learning it at a mass scale right now,\" Wara said.</p><p>After a June shut-off in the Sierra foothills, PG&E workers reported repairing numerous areas of wind damage, including power lines hit by tree branches.</p><p>\"That was worth it,\" Wara said of the deliberate blackout. \"That could have prevented a catastrophe.\"</p><p>———</p><p>Cooper reported from Phoenix.

Tsai wrote that Morey should have understood he was broaching a \"third-rail issue\" in China with his tweet, but conceded that the NBA executive has a right to \"freely express\" his opinion.</p><p>\"The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland.

Still, Kakos says, shoppers may turn price conscious just as shelves are well-stocked for the holidays.</p><p>\"People come in with the perceived idea of, is this more expensive? Has this gone up?\" he says.</p><p>Wine retailers, distributors and importers already expect some customers to seek reds and whites from countries whose products aren\'t being taxed. And any signs that customers are balking at higher prices will force retailers to absorb their increased costs.</p><p>The tariffs are mostly on food and alcoholic beverage products such as cheese from Britain, Switzerland and Italy; olive oil from Spain; Scotch whisky and French, Spanish and German wines. They\'re also being imposed on equipment from kitchen knives to large aircraft. The administration is imposing them in retaliation for the European Union\'s subsidies of aircraft maker Airbus, the competitor to the U.S. producer Boeing.</p><p>The tariffs will be slapped on goods that arrive in the U.S. from Friday onward. One bit of good news is that much of the food and beverages to be sold during the holiday season is now in the country and headed to store shelves, so retailers generally won\'t have to suddenly come up with extra cash to pay for holiday merchandise.</p><p>\"Most people are going to be OK\" in terms of buying for the holidays, says Joe Gellert, president of World\'s Best Cheeses, a distributor with operations in New York and California.</p><p>But retailers who are his customers are worried about the long-term impact of the tariffs; they\'re hoping for trade talks between the U.S. and EU and that the Trump administration will withdraw the tariffs as it recently did with some imposed on Chinese goods.</p><p>And while retailers believe customers willing to spend top dollar on upscale products like Bordeaux and single-malt Scotch will be willing to pay extra to get the labels they want, the business owners aren\'t complacent.</p><p>\"We have not yet made any changes in respect to tariffs being implemented but we will be sure to keep an eye on the market,\" says Giles Cadman, owner of Golden West International, a San Francisco-based fine wines retailer.</p><p>Price-sensitive customers are aware they have many other choices when it comes to purchases like wine and cheese, so owners may need to change the products that they stock. Shoppers may opt for buy wine from a country like South Africa or Chile whose products are not subject to tariffs, or they may switch from a single-malt Scotch to a cheaper blend or domestically made bourbon. Instead of Stilton, they may choose an artisanal cheese from Vermont.</p><p>\"We will have to make changes to our mix because in this competitive wine market, it\'s not easy to pass rising costs to retailers and consumers,\" says Brett Vankoski, wine director for Latitude Beverage, a wine seller headquartered in Boston.</p><p>Perhaps a bigger concern is what will happen after the holidays. People in the wine business are concerned that if the tariffs are still in effect, sales of popular French rose wines will fall next summer. Those wines are scheduled to be shipped to the U.S. early in 2020.</p><p>\"French rose is one of the fastest-growing wines in the country and is a big contributor to the growth of our company and the industry as a whole,\" says Kevin Mehra, CEO of Latitude Beverage. \"The tariff has the potential to slow that growth.\"</p><p>Retailers, distributors and importers have strategies to cushion the impact of the tariffs and avoid having to charge consumers the full 25%. Each business in the distribution chain can agree to absorb a portion of the tariff.</p><p>\"One strategy is to raise the price on everything 1% and marking up these items (with tariffs) only 5%,\" Gellert says. Another tack is for a distributor or retailer to look at merchandise critically, with an eye toward winnowing out products they really don\'t need on their shelves, he says.</p><p>Retailers have less pricing leeway in states where alcoholic beverage control agencies regulate wine, liquor and beer prices and the timing of price increases.</p><p>In New Hampshire, for example, prices are set twice a year. \"This could be detrimental to companies that will now lose money on products affected by the tariffs for potentially up to six months,\" Mehra says.</p><p>But retailers of products like wine and cheese have advantages over, for example, companies that need to import steel and aluminum from the EU that\'s also being taxed by the Trump administration. It\'s not easy to find metal and metal products without tariffs, but food and alcohol purveyors have many options.</p><p>Cadman noted that even if a particular French wine becomes too pricey, there are plenty of similar ones from other countries. Sauvignon blanc, a white wine produced in California and New Zealand, is similar to France\'s Sancerre.</p><p>And, Vankoski noted, another huge European producer isn\'t being hit by import duties.</p><p>\"Italian wines are not impacted by the tariffs,\" he says.</p><p>—————</p><p>Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

From the top of the foul mound — a collection of almost every piece of garbage discarded on the island since it went all-in on financial services in the 1960s — I imagined I could just make out the enshrouded beach estate of the secretive investor Kenneth Dart.</p><p>I had been on Grand Cayman for more than a week, but I was no closer to speaking with him than when I first arrived. The heir to a famously private foam-container dynasty and a reclusive businessman in his own right, Mr. Dart apparently hasn’t spoken to the press since 1993. Though he has lived on Grand Cayman for 25 years and is widely believed to be the biggest private landholder on the archipelago, almost nobody I interviewed was sure if they had seen him. Residents compared him to Batman, Howard Hughes, a Bond villain and both Warren and Jimmy Buffett.</p><p>Mr. Dart lives on Seven Mile Beach, in an old hotel — the entire hotel — once known as the West Indian Club. He acquired the property in 1994 after renouncing his United States citizenship, a tax dodge so audacious it inspired federal legislation. Though Cayman was initially a refuge for the financier, Mr. Dart, who is thought to be 64, has taken to his adopted home with zeal. With his fortune and his company, Dart Enterprises, he has increasingly come to define the islands’ future.</p><p>In 2007, he opened a major development, a sprawling mix of retail and entertainment venues called Camana Bay, and began amassing a portfolio of high-end properties. His list now includes the Ritz-Carlton, the Yacht Club and a new Kimpton resort. In February, his group proposed a $1.5 billion “iconic skyscraper” that would rival the Eiffel Tower and the Burj Khalifa of Dubai.</p><p>As a place to conduct business, Cayman’s appeal is obvious. The country, a British Overseas Territory, levies no income or corporate taxes, and, since the 1960s, it has become one of the world’s most sophisticated banking centers. While Cayman was once a shady place to stash illicit cash — a reputation cemented by the 1991 John Grisham novel “The Firm” and a subsequent Tom Cruise thriller — it has long since moved aggressively upmarket, courting institutional investors, private equity and trading firms seeking to minimize taxes and bureaucracy. As of 2016, according to one analysis, it domiciled 60 percent of global hedge fund assets.</p><p>But for his base of operations, Mr. Dart has chosen an existentially vulnerable piece of land. At 76 square miles, Grand Cayman is roughly the size of Brooklyn and is, on average, only seven feet above sea level. In 2004, Ivan, a Category 5 hurricane, submerged most of the island. The damage was valued at close to $3 billion. Bodies buried in beach cemeteries floated out to sea. Animals escaped their enclosures, and, to this day, rewilded chickens roam the islands.</p><p>“Problem is, even if hurricanes don’t get any more prevalent, they’ll get stronger,” said James Whittaker, a Caymanian who is a former banker and regulator turned clean energy entrepreneur. “If sea-level rise is a foot, well, that means that a Category 1 now is going to do the same damage that a Category 4 used to do.” Even if Cayman built enough infrastructure to survive the rising water, he added, “The problem is insurance. You’ll never be able to insure the country anymore.”</p><p>As I stood atop Mount Trashmore, looking out at the crystalline water, I wondered what Mr. Dart thought about the country’s vulnerability to rising seas. Or if, like me, he had quickly fallen into a tropical reverie — a feeling that nothing could possibly go wrong on this exclusive stretch of paradise. Would a wildly successful investor like him buy up so much of a country that was really doomed to disappear?</p><h2>‘A Caymanian dream’</h2><p>Until the 1960s, when the first banking laws were put in place to attract international capital, the Cayman Islands was a backwater, with an economy dependent on seamen who would send their remittances back home. When a Cambridge-trained lawyer named William Walker arrived in 1963, he described the place as having “cows wandering through Georgetown, only one bank, only one paved road, and no telephones.” The population was just over 8,000, and the mangrove-covered island was swarming with mosquitoes.</p><p>The banks moved in first, then the accounting and law firms. Seven Mile Beach, previously undeveloped, became an international tourist attraction for both divers and money managers. By the end of the 1990s, the jurisdiction had established itself firmly as a leading global banking center, and today financial services accounts for over half of its economy.</p><p>Proponents of the Cayman business model argue that its benefits accrue to all of the islands’ citizens, who can boast of having one of the highest gross domestic products per capita in the world. Foreign capital, much of it in the form of duties and fees, helps fund schools and infrastructure. Regulations direct employers to give special consideration to Caymanians for jobs and require that Caymanians own shares in local businesses. But many islanders complain of a two-tiered system. Caymanians get jobs, but are then passed over for promotions. The best-paid positions often go to highly educated expatriates, who make up just under half the resident population of about 66,000.</p><p>“They say this is a trickle-down economy,” said Roy Bodden, a historian of the Cayman Islands and former member of the Legislative Assembly. “So, here’s my argument. Why should it be a trickle for us? Why aren’t we holding the cup?” Mr. Bodden has been a vocal critic of the islands’ unchecked development and what he sees as the disenfranchisement of the island population. “You talk about the American dream, well, we had a Caymanian dream,” he said. The way he told the story, the elites had sold the country out.</p><p>When Kenneth Dart relocated to Grand Cayman, his secretiveness and colorful business dealings aroused local suspicion. In 1993, his home in Sarasota, Fla., burned to the ground in an arson that was never fully explained. After Mr. Dart renounced his ties to America a few months later, he moved first to Belize, whose government in 1995 proposed to the State Department a Belizean consulate in Sarasota, where Mr. Dart and his family could live, presumably tax-free. The idea was never seriously considered, and Mr. Dart settled on Grand Cayman.</p><p>It is a closely guarded secret how much of the three-island territory — Little Cayman and Cayman Brac hover just to the northeast of the big island — Mr. Dart and his subsidiaries own. Many islanders take it for granted that he is the biggest private landholder on the islands, and some suspect he owns more land than the government. (A spokeswoman for Dart Enterprises said the company would not comment on its investment decisions.)</p><p>After the 2008 financial crisis, the Cayman economy contracted. But Mr. Dart picked up the slack. In addition to resorts, office buildings and residential properties, his company began planning and building major municipal infrastructure projects like tunnels and roads, reinvigorating long-held concerns on Grand Cayman that Mr. Dart and his subsidiaries controlled too much of the island. A 2015 audit of the government’s land management scolded ministers for allowing Dart subsidiaries such free rein.</p><h2>An audacious plan for Mount Trashmore</h2><p>Some speculate Mr. Dart is private because he fears for his safety. As the scion of a Michigan family business, Dart Container, that has long dominated the polystyrene foam market (it also makes plastic Solo cups and other iconic food service products), Mr. Dart was born into a significant fortune. But he also had a talent for trading, making lucrative investments over the decades in financial firms, biotech companies, Russian public vouchers and steeply discounted sovereign debt in Greece and Argentina, among many other companies and countries. Some investments made him enemies. His yacht was armored to withstand torpedo fire, one of his two brothers, Tom, told Bloomberg News in 1995. When he first moved to the islands, he could be seen flanked by bodyguards.</p><p>In 2014, Mr. Dart stepped down as president of his family’s container business and has, according to comments made in 2015 by the Dart Enterprises chief executive, Mark VanDevelde, become more focused on real-estate development and conservation. He also oversees an extensive nursery on the island, where he collects native and endemic trees and plants.</p><p>According to materials shared or published by Dart Enterprises, the company has invested more than $1.5 billion in the Cayman Islands, with another $1 billion in the development pipeline. This does not include the estimated price tag for the skyscraper. Bloomberg puts Mr. Dart’s net worth at $5.8 billion. “They’ll tell you they have ‘patient capital,’” Mr. Whittaker said. “That’s the word they like to use. Which means ‘I’m going to throw two, three billion dollars in the ground and my kids or my grandkids will reap the rewards once it gets built.’”</p><p>Mr. Dart’s vision for Cayman is comprehensive. In a 2018 video presented at the local Chamber of Commerce, his company outlined a building program that would connect the white sands of Seven Mile Beach to a protected bay known as the North Sound, incorporating extensive landscaped pedestrian parks and revamped roadways — in effect, designing a whole town. It would include major new residential developments and offices, in addition to yet another five-star resort on a stretch of beach that abuts the billionaire’s residence.</p><p>The plans reminded me of a game of Monopoly — if a player purchased all of the fanciest properties and packed them with houses and hotels for money managers. When I went to the island, I made an effort to book one of the few Seven Mile Beach hotels that Mr. Dart doesn’t own; halfway through my stay, I read an announcement in the local paper that he had bought it.</p><p>Improbably enough, Mr. Dart’s most audacious investment involves Mount Trashmore. Haphazardly established in the 1960s, the massive garbage pile was never trenched or lined, and no one knows what might be leaking from the dump into the ground. Parts of the mountain sometimes spontaneously combust, requiring evacuation of local businesses and a nearby Dart-developed private school. Since Mr. Dart started building on Grand Cayman, the dump has been an obstacle, impeding new development. His company has proposed to cap Mount Trashmore and build a new waste-to-energy facility to dispose of future garbage, which it would manage for the next 25 years, at an estimated cost of nearly half a billion dollars.</p><p>The arrangement — the heir to a disposable-cup fortune offering to clean up an entire country’s garbage — seemed remarkable to me, but the Caymanians I spoke with didn’t bat an eye. Except when the stink wafted down the mountain; then they batted their eyes a lot, because they were watering.</p><h2>Risks of a meltdown</h2><p>For three weeks before arriving on the island, I corresponded with a Dart company spokeswoman, who made it cordially clear that an interview with Mr. Dart was a non-starter. At one point, she offered to consider written questions and present them to Dart executives. I asked what Mr. Dart saw from a real-estate perspective in Cayman. “Not everyone who moves to a place they love invests in it so heavily,” I wrote. I also asked about the dump and the risks of global warming. As far as I knew, Mr. Dart was neither a climate skeptic nor a denier, and yet he continued to acquire significant parcels of a country that was, topographically speaking, one of the most vulnerable on earth.</p><p>Nick Robson, the founder of the Cayman Institute, a nonprofit organization that has advocated better long-term planning on the island, says Cayman is nowhere near prepared for rising seas and extreme weather. We met on the terrace at a Westin resort, which, like many developments on Seven Mile Beach, is on an elevated concrete slab. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said, predicted that sea levels would rise by roughly one meter by the end of the century.</p><p>Some people minimize the risk, he said: “‘Well, O.K., that’s three-and-a-quarter feet. Oh, no big thing.’ Sorry, we’re seven feet above sea level, for the most part. That’s halfway up! When you model a hurricane with storm surge, you can have 15 feet of storm surge, and then you’re looking at 18½ feet above normal sea level.” (None of the many elected officials I contacted would agree to be interviewed on the record, but Suzette Ebanks, the chief information officer, sent a three-page response to written questions that highlighted several initiatives, including “environmental impact assessments for major capital projects” and a focus on transitioning to renewable energy.)</p><p>Mr. Robson said he also worried that Cayman’s economic reliance on financial services wasn’t sustainable. “It’s almost a post-colonial dispensation,” he said, describing the sometimes uneasy relationship that has always existed between Cayman, Britain and the international community.</p><p>After the 2008 financial crisis, the political will to reform systems that facilitate tax avoidance reached a high. In 2010, the United States passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires foreign financial institutions to identify American citizens who are account holders and report that to the Treasury. Since 2013, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been creating an international framework that aims to reduce corporate tax avoidance, particularly for large multinational and Internet-based firms.</p><p>Meanwhile, Britain has promised to adopt a set of stringent European Union policies designed to combat money laundering and terrorism. If fully implemented, protectorates like Cayman would be expected to create public registers of company owners and provide access to the names of the beneficiaries of trusts. The registers could be accessible not only to law enforcement but also to those with “legitimate interest,” including investigative journalists and nongovernmental organizations. “What’s in the wind now is potentially existential for the financial services industry in Cayman,” said Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a watchdog group. “I think it does start to look like it could be a perfect storm for Cayman.”</p><p>If the colonial period was Cayman’s opening act, and financial services its middle, it seemed to me that Mr. Dart was quietly preparing for Cayman’s possible finale: as an upscale tax domicile and tourist attraction for the global ultra-wealthy who could afford to come and go from an existentially imperiled island.</p><p>Justin Howe, a Dart group executive vice president, talked up the proposed skyscraper’s benefits at a recent economic forum. “We’re looking to bring in more high net worth, ultrahigh net worth, potentially even more billionaires,” he said during a question-and-answer session. “They take virtually nothing out of the economy and they put massive amounts into the economy, so we think that’s what a five-, five-plus-star resort has the potential to do.”</p><p>The plan is to build the tower set back from Seven Mile Beach, in the middle of the Camana Bay development. Whatever might happen with international tax legislation or volatile financial markets, the building would be a hedge of sorts, positioned to bring in capital and withstand the rising ocean.</p><p>“Is everything he does great?

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and the First Amendment.</p><p>The address was an unusually public doubling down by the tech billionaire on a free speech stance that has been highly criticized. “It was a sign of how Mr. Zuckerberg was trying to reposition Facebook in a politicized environment where the company had been accused of amplifying disinformation, hate speech and violent content,” Ms. Kang and Mr. Isaac write.</p><p>The speech did little to quell criticism of the company. “Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation,” Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted last night. “Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once.

That promises further pain for Beijing — and the rest of the world, too.</p><p>The growth rate is China’s slowest pace in nearly three decades of modern record-keeping, Mr. Bradsher notes. The pace is at the low end of Beijing’s official economic growth target.</p><p>There are several factors to blame:</p><p>• The trade war with the U.S., which is still raging despite recent breakthroughs in negotiations between Washington and Beijing</p><p>• Slumps in the country’s huge automotive and real estate sectors</p><p>• A swine fever epidemic that has decimated its pig population</p><p>A slowdown was inevitable, but this is more than economists had anticipated. Analysts had expected a growth rate of about 6.1 percent, according to the FT.</p><p>That has consequences for the global economy. The I.M.F. had said earlier this week that worldwide growth would fall to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>China has its work cut out to find a solution. “The biggest challenge is to find new growth drivers from consumption and technology, as old ones such as property and globalization are fading out,” Larry Hu, the head of China economics at Macquarie, told the NYT.</p><h2>Saudi Aramco delays its giant I.P.O.</h2><p>The state-owned oil giant is said to have pushed back its initial public offering, creating another setback for what would be the biggest-ever stock market debut.</p><p>Aramco had been expected to announce its I.P.O. plans on Sunday, and then publish the offering prospectus around Oct. 25. The current plan is to list up to 3 percent of the company’s shares on the local Tadawul exchange.</p><p>The company reportedly wants to incorporate third-quarter financial results into its offering materials, unnamed sources told the WSJ. It also wants more data to reassure the markets that operations have returned to normal after drone attacks on its facilities last month.</p><p>Some prospective investors had pushed back against the I.P.O. process, according to the WSJ. Executives from Fidelity Investments were reportedly dissatisfied with the level of financial disclosure offered up by Aramco executives.</p><p>It’s the latest delay in what has been a drawn-out process. The Saudi government had already paused Aramco’s I.P.O. process once before, instead pushing the company to buy control of a state-owned chemical producer.</p><p>And some questions about the I.P.O. plans remain unanswered, including whether the Saudi government would accept a valuation for Aramco of less than $2 trillion. People with knowledge of the planning have said that the company would most likely be valued by investors at closer to $1.5 trillion.</p><h2>The Brexit deal may not make it past Parliament</h2><p>Investors were briefly elated yesterday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain struck a deal with the E.U. over leaving the bloc. But they have since grown worried that the agreement may be rejected by British lawmakers.</p><p>European businesses cautiously welcomed news of the deal, but aren’t willing to resume investment plans that they had suspended because of uncertainty over Brexit. “We’re not at the end of the process,” a spokesman for the French carmaker PSA Group told the WSJ.</p><p>Analysts said that the plan wasn’t much different from a no-deal Brexit, and would reduce British income per capita by an estimated 2.5 percent compared with staying in the E.U., according to the research group U.K. in a Changing Europe. (Britain’s finance minister, Sajid Javid, has rejected calls for an official assessment of the economic impact of the agreement.)</p><p>There is plenty of opposition in Parliament:</p><p>• Mr. Johnson’s allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland said they could not accept the proposal in its current form, since it would separate the territory from the rest of Britain.</p><p>• A group of hard-line Conservative lawmakers signaled they may back the Unionist Party.</p><p>• And opposition parties, including Labour and the Liberal Democrats, appear determined to deal Mr. Johnson another defeat.</p><p>Yet Mr. Johnson may seize a political victory even if he loses, since he could blame lawmakers for rejecting a deal. He would make that argument in a general election, hoping to regain a majority in Parliament.</p><p>The British pound went on a wild ride yesterday, rising to nearly $1.30 before falling to around $1.27. As of this morning, it traded at about $1.28.</p><h2>The G.M. strike isn’t over yet</h2><p>U.A.W. representatives voted to approve a tentative agreement with General Motors yesterday, but the monthlong strike won’t end until rank-and-file workers have a vote, Neal Boudette of the NYT writes.</p><p>The four-year deal includes wage increases and a pathway to full-time employment for temporary workers. It also eliminates a system in which workers receive different pay for equivalent jobs, based on when they were hired.</p><p>But the deal will not address a previous sticking point: reopening plants and bringing jobs back to the U.S. from Mexico. Under the agreement, production will continue at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which G.M. had previously planned to close. Three plants that have already closed will not reopen, though displaced workers will receive retirement incentives.</p><p>The walkout will continue for at least a week. The 49,000 members of U.A.W. at G.M. plants will get a chance to vote, starting tomorrow.</p><h2>China wanted N.B.A. executive fired over Hong Kong tweet</h2><p>The Chinese government asked the N.B.A. to fire the Houston Rockets executive who tweeted in support of Hong Kong protesters, the league’s commissioner, Adam Silver said yesterday, according to Sopan Deb of the NYT.</p><p>“We said there’s no chance that’s happening,” Mr. Silver said. “There’s no chance we’ll even discipline him.”</p><p>The league was caught in a firestorm earlier this month after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted in support of protesters in Hong Kong. The N.B.A defended his right to free speech.</p><p>Mr. Silver said the financial fallout has “already been substantial” for the league, but he continued to defend its decision not to discipline Mr. Morey. “We wanted to make an absolutely clear statement that the values of the N.B.A., these American values — we are an American business — travel with us wherever we go,” Mr. Silver said. “And one of those values is free expression.”</p><p>He also stood up for Joe Tsai, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets and a co-founder of Alibaba, who had criticized Mr. Morey and the Hong Kong protesters. “I thought that’s perfectly appropriate, too,” Mr. Silver said.</p><p>It’s unclear what the dust-up will mean for the N.B.A.’s future in China. For now, its games remain off the air there. “I felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people, and I have regret that much of that was lost,” Mr. Silver said. “And I’m not even sure where we’ll go from here.”</p><h2>Revolving door</h2><p>Robin Daniels reportedly plans to step down as WeWork’s chief marketing officer.</p><p>David Warren plans to retire as C.F.O. of the London Stock Exchange Group by the end of 2020.</p><p>Bank of America hired Gary Howe from Lazard as a co-head of its AMRS financial institutions group, focusing on banks. It also hired Scott Langley from the National Bank of Canada as an investment banker covering metals and mining companies in Canada.</p><h2>The speed read</h2><p>Deals</p><p>• AT&amp;T is said to be in talks with Elliott Management to settle the hedge fund’s activist shareholder campaign, which could include reviewing potential sales of assets or changing up its board.

Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. ... So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\'t think so.\" — Minneapolis rally Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\'s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target.</p><p>Trump\'s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\'s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.</p><p>———</p><p>IMPEACHMENT</p><p>TRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>TRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ... I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \'Colluded\' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" — tweet Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That\'s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.</p><p>The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.</p><p>Trump\'s reference to a \"fraudulent speech\" comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president\'s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>Schiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character.\"</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.</p><p>The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.</p><p>———</p><p>SYRIA and TURKEY</p><p>TRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \"I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\'t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged...down.\" — tweets Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: That\'s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.</p><p>Both Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.</p><p>Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\'s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don\'t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.</p><p>Some of Turkey\'s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Thursday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat.</p><p>IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\' self-declared caliphate.</p><p>Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.</p><p>U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \"eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\"</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\'t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.</p><p>The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.</p><p>As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ...including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Most of them came from Europe.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.</p><p>Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.</p><p>Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.</p><p>———</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\'s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \"they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\" — tweet Wednesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.</p><p>Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Monday on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel didn\'t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Monday on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 11:52:28', '2019-10-18 11:52:28', 'ap-fact-check-trumps-shoddy-info-on-syria-impeachment'),

Suddenly, an application or tax form is kicked back.</p><p>\"And the parents go, \'What are you talking about?\' They don\'t even know what this means,\" says Velasquez, whose nonprofit helps victims of identity theft. \"And ... through no fault of their own, they\'re left holding the bag and they are the ones that are now responsible for cleaning up that mess.\"</p><p>AN IDENTITY THEFT VICTIM AT BIRTH?</p><p>The rise in synthetic identity theft — where criminals piece together a fake consumer — is an unintended consequence of Social Security number \"randomization,\" which was initiated in 2011 to expand the pool of available numbers, she says.</p><p>Old Social Security numbers had clues to geography and birth dates in the digits. Randomizing the numbers made it harder for scammers to guess them — but also made it harder for creditors to spot the bogus use of a Social Security number on an application.</p><p>Before randomization, criminals typically purchased minors\' Social Security numbers on the black market or tracked down the numbers of dead children. But now, sometimes the number \"is just completely made up,\" Velasquez says. Fraud-detection measures used previously have become ineffective because it\'s no longer possible to pair a Social Security number with a location or approximate age.</p><p>Criminals often start with a not-yet-issued Social Security number to create a fake identity. If it works, the number becomes attached to a credit file for a consumer who doesn\'t exist.</p><p>HOW THE NUMBER GETS IN THE CREDIT SYSTEM</p><p>\"You can create a credit file with almost nothing,\" says Adam Levi n, chairman and founder of CyberScout, a company offering identity theft education and resolution services. When a credit card application with a previously unused Social Security number arrives, a new credit file is started based on the information in that application.</p><p>The thief often starts small, say, with a card marketed to credit newbies, then builds on that to get more accounts with bigger credit limits. Then, they suddenly max out all the accounts — a \"bust-out\" scheme — and walk away, leaving the accounts to go to collections and never to be paid. The child\'s credit reputation is left in tatters, but that\'s often not discovered until the child is old enough to apply for credit, by seeking a college loan, for example.</p><p>Velasquez says the solution lies in creating a process where financial institutions and other credit grantors can verify an applicant\'s name and number with the Social Security Administration for identity confirmation. That\'s in the works, she says.</p><p>IT\'S ESSENTIAL TO FREEZE CREDIT</p><p>In the meantime, the best protection is to freeze kids\' credit . While it\'s possible parents will discover that a child\'s Social Security number has already been used to build a synthetic identity, chances are it hasn\'t. (If it has, the sooner you clean up the mess , the better.)</p><p>Freezing a child\'s credit can prevent their Social Security number from being used to open bogus credit accounts. Both Levin and Velasquez say they \"absolutely\" recommend freezing a newborn\'s credit.</p><p>The mechanics are relatively simple. Parents will need to make and send copies of documents, including birth certificates, Social Security cards and government-issued identification, to each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.</p><p>Go online to Equifax and Experian to print out request forms to complete and mail in with the required copies of documents. The mailing address is on each form. TransUnion doesn\'t have an online form; instead, to request a freeze, write a letter and send document copies to TransUnion, P.O. Box 380, Woodlyn, PA 19094.</p><p>Each credit bureau will send confirmation of the freeze, as well as a personal identification number. The PINs will be needed to unfreeze the credit file, so it\'s essential to keep that information and store it in a secure place.</p><p>\"Even if it is a little difficult, this is what parents should be doing,\" Levin says about freezing kids\' credit.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

Yet the grievances that led them to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\'s goods remain largely unresolved.</p><p>The administration agreed to suspend a tariff hike on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday. And China agreed to buy up to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.</p><p>The de-escalation in tension between the world\'s two largest economies was welcomed by financial markets. The U.S.-China hostilities have alarmed investors and escalated costs and uncertainties for many businesses.</p><p>President Donald Trump announced the cease-fire in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The news followed two days of talks in Washington, the 13th round of negotiations between the two countries\' delegations.</p><p>\"It took us a long time to get here, but it\'s something that\'s going to be great for China and great for the USA,\" Trump said.</p><p>Many of the details, though, remained to be worked out. And some of the thorniest issues — such as U.S. allegations that China forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets — were dealt with only partially, or not at all, and will require further talks.</p><p>\"The president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven\'t,\" said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p><p>The negotiators have so far reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed.</p><p>And the threat of escalation still hangs over the two countries: Trump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs that are set to take effect Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products — a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.</p><p>While providing scant details of what was agreed to Friday, the White House said Beijing pledged to be more transparent about how it sets the value of its currency, the yuan. The administration has long accused China of manipulating the yuan lower to give its exporters a competitive edge in foreign markets.</p><p>China has also agreed to open its markets to U.S. banks and other financial services providers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.</p><p>The trade war has inflicted an economic toll on both countries. U.S. manufacturers have been deeply hurt by rising costs from the tariffs and by uncertainty over when and how the trade hostilities may end. Friday\'s truce at least opens the door to progress.</p><p>\"They\'re trying to de-escalate,\" said Timothy Keeler, a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives. \"I think it serves both sides\' interests because both sides were feeling pain.\"</p><p>Stock prices had been up substantially all day, mainly in anticipation of a significant trade agreement. But once the White House announced the contours of the tentative accord, the market shed some of its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 500 points at its high, closed up 319.</p><p>\"This is an encouraging first phase,\" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. \"We await word on how implementation will be measured and in what timeframe, as well as details on scheduling subsequent phases.\"</p><p>The U.S. and Chinese negotiators didn\'t deal this week with a major dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Huawei, saying it poses a threat to national security because its equipment can be used for espionage. Trump has said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.</p><p>The administration still has in place tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. What changed Friday was that Trump suspended plans to raise existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products from 25% to 30% next week.</p><p>Beijing has lashed back by taxing about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on soybeans and other agricultural products in a shot at Trump supporters in rural America.</p><p>Last year, U.S. farm exports to China plummeted 53% to less than $9.2 billion. The additional Chinese purchases that were promised Friday could provide an economic boost to hard-hit U.S. farmers. Mnuchin said the $40 billion to $50 billion in agricultural sales cited by Trump is an annual amount that would be ramped up to \"within the second year\" of the agreement.</p><p>The two sides were close to a more comprehensive deal in early May. But talks stalled after the administration accused China of reneging on earlier commitments. Trump acknowledged that Friday\'s deal has yet to be put down on paper but said that wouldn\'t be a problem.</p><p>\"China wants it badly, and we want it also,\" the president said. \"We should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\"</p><p>Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, drew encouragement from Friday\'s developments.</p><p>\"Finally, a ray of hope for the U.S.-China trade relationship,\" he said. \"While there remains significant work ahead to address many of the most important U.S. trade and investment priorities, we will continue to lend our full support.\"</p><p>Still, Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, suggested that the partial nature of the deal won\'t relieve much of the uncertainty surrounding trade policy that has discouraged many American companies from investing in new equipment and expanding.</p><p>\"For businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty ... \"Beyond the promises and niceties, the deal doesn\'t address key underlying issues,\" Daco said in a research note.</p><p>The two countries are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration\'s assertions that China deploys predatory tactics — including outright theft — in a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.</p><p>Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration.

', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191001145300-smart-farm-drone-acquahmeyer-2-super-tease.jpeg', '<p>London (CNN Business)A farmer\'s fortunes bloom and wither with the seasons. It can be precarious work, and a bad year can leave fields barren and grain sheds empty -- slim pickings on which to survive until the next harvest.</p><div>More than half of working Africans have jobs in agriculture, but poor infrastructure, inadequate tools and a lack of investment have left the continent\'s mostly small-scale farms struggling to feed a growing population. Now, a wave of technological solutions is aiming to help.</div><div>Flying to the rescue</div><div>In Ghana, a company called Acquahmeyer rents out drones that help small-scale farmers check the health of crops and use pesticide only where it is needed, reducing pollution and health risks.</div><div>\"Ghanaian vegetables were not making it to the EU countries because of pesticide residues on the fruit and vegetables,\" says chief operations officer Kenneth A. Nelson.</div><div>With drones, farmers can identify pests and disease to determine exactly which crops need spraying, Nelson says. Thanks to the reduced use of chemicals (pesticide use dropped 50 percent in some cases), it\'s easier for farmers to meet EU countries\' regulatory limits.</div><div>Acquahmeyer is now working with 8,000 farmers, who pay $5 to $10 per acre, about 6 times a year, to assess their crops and soil and apply pesticides. Each drone costs $5,000 to $15,000 to build and can spray 10,000 acres a year.</div><div>The company started in June 2018 with two drones and now has 10. It makes an annual profit of $15,000 to $30,000 per drone, after operations and administration costs. With more than 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of agricultural land in Ghana, demand for drones is only growing, says Nelson.</div><div>Acquahmeyer\'s strategy of training locals to pilot and repair the aircraft is helping fuel interest in the company and its growth, says Nelson. \"In every farming community we have ambassadors for our company who are pilots and we are creating jobs,\" he says. \"We want to make sure that technology and agriculture becomes an exciting job.\"</div><div>Urban farming</div><div>In Uganda, urban development has been blamed for eating into agricultural land just as population growth is boosting demand for food.</div><div>More than 1.6 million people live in the capital, Kampala, where levels of malnutrition are rising, according to the United Nations. To combat the problem, some city dwellers are growing their own food and selling it.</div><div>Diana Nambatya Nsubuga, who has a Ph.D. in public health, opened Kwagala Farm with her husband in their half-acre backyard in Kampala in 2010. She used her profits to expand and to begin providing affordable training on \"urban farming\" -- with sessions on growing crops in spaces like tires, pipes, wooden shelves or apartment rooftops as well as classes on raising poultry.</div><div>Nsubuga says she started out with a packet of tomato seeds worth 50 cents. \"When we started making good income, we decided to diversify beyond just tomatoes to other vegetables\" like cabbages, carrots, and spinach, she says.</div><div>The couple bought 10 chickens and two cows. Disposing of cow dung became a problem, so they installed a biogas plant to convert it to electricity for lighting and cooking. Waste from the biogas plant, called bio slurry, was turned into organic fertilizer to sell to other urban farmers.</div><div>Kwagala Farm now makes a profit of $60,000 a year, with about 80 percent coming from fertilizer sales. Nsubuga has invested in machines that should allow her to increase production from one ton to 20 to 25 tons a month.</div><div>Of the 1,800 people she\'s trained, half now have their own urban farms, Nsubuga says. The farms generate an average of $5,000 a year, she says, a nice addition to urban farmers\' salaries. The average annual income in Uganda is $660, according to the latest data from the International Labour Organization.</div><div>Nsubuga aims to train a further 2,000 farmers by the end of 2020.</div><div>Weathering the seasons</div><div>Esther Usman, from Kaduna State, Northwest Nigeria, has been growing maize since she was 17, when she dropped out of school to support her family after her father\'s death.</div><div>Two decades on, she was struggling. She often lay awake at night worrying about how to feed and educate her children. At times, money ran so low that she was forced to sell her crop for a pittance.</div><div>\"If my farm was affected by pests, I could only afford to buy a small amount of (pesticide), which was usually not effective,\" says Usman, now 38. And since maize in storage is often lost to moisture, pests or fungi, she said storing maize after harvesting was a problem.</div><div>In 2017, Usman joined Babban Gona, a social enterprise that acts as a farmers\' cooperative and offers small-scale farmers loans, credit, training and other support. It launched in 2012 with 102 farmers, and now works with 20,000.</div><div>Field officers employed by Babban Gona photograph its farmers\' fields. An app reviews the photos, evaluating the germination rate and seeing if the soil needs nutrients based on leaf colors. The field officers step in to alert farmers of any problems they find and advise on possible solutions. Some farmers have increased their yields by 50 percent.</div><div>Once the maize is harvested, Babban Gona stores it in sealed containers and aims to sell it in bulk at the right time to maximize the farmers\' profits.</div><div>The quarterly payments Usman receives from Babban Gona allowed her to invest in a cow and a grinding machine, to buy new clothes for her family, and to build a house.</div><div>\"[It] helps me to pay for some things during the dry season when there isn\'t a lot of money around,\" she says. \"I also don\'t have to struggle for capital during the next farming season.\"</div><div>Usman says the money is helping to keep her children in school, and she hopes they may one day become doctors, lawyers or teachers.</div><p></p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 14:31:08', '2019-10-18 14:31:08', 'high-tech-solutions-are-helping-farming-to-flourish');

Now it is under the spotlight.</p><p>PG&amp;E’s chief executive said Thursday night that the utility did a poor job in executing the blackout, even if its intentions — pre-empting wildfires caused by its equipment — were sound.</p><p>“We understand that the size and scope of this event is untenable in the long term,” the chief executive, Bill Johnson, said in a letter sent to the state’s Public Utilities Commission late Thursday. “Events such as these cannot become the status quo in California.”</p><p>Thursday was the deadline set by the commission for PG&amp;E to answer for its performance last week and explain what it intended to do differently in the future. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Johnson and other PG&amp;E officials will appear at a commission hearing in San Francisco at which they can expect to be aggressively questioned.</p><p>[“This did not go well”: Inside PG&amp;E’s control room during the blackout.]</p><p>In his letter, Mr. Johnson continued to promise that he would deliver on improvements he was hired to make when he took the job last January. “PG&amp;E remains committed to bettering its practices and system,” he wrote.</p><p>But Mr. Johnson must make his case to a commission that has expressed its frustration with the handling of the blackouts. The power shut-offs left two million people in the dark — many without notice and for days — forced businesses and schools to close and endangered people with life-threatening health conditions.</p><p>PG&amp;E, in bankruptcy after amassing tens of billions of dollars in liabilities related to recent wildfires caused by its equipment, has become known for its system failures that include a gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people and last year’s Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed scores more.</p><p>Last week the trouble was the faltering of PG&amp;E’s communication and computer systems, in particular the utility’s website, which crashed twice as the lights went out.</p><p>“Throughout the event, PG&amp;E had multiple issues with communication, coordination, and event and resource management,” Marybel Batjer, president of the utilities commission wrote in the letter to Mr. Johnson, calling for him to appear before her agency. Referring to a public-safety power shut-off, she added, “Failures in execution, combined with the magnitude of this P.S.P.S. event, created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated.”</p><p>The commission also informed the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, to review the orders given to PG&amp;E regarding last week’s power shut-offs to ensure that “there is not a repeat of any of last week’s mistakes in any part of the state in the future.”</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom told the commission that he intended to urge Mr. Johnson to give consumers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 for residential customers and $250 for small businesses. Mr. Newsom said PG&amp;E’s use of the power shut-off strategy highlighted how disorganized the utility remains after numerous complaints, court cases and regulatory issues.</p><p>“The scope and duration of this outage was unacceptable,” Mr. Newsom said. “It was clear from the start that PG&amp;E implemented this extraordinary measure with astounding neglect and lack of preparation.”</p><p>The governor called on the commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the event, including failures in planning, decision making and execution.</p><p>A new look at PG&amp;E’s operations would add to a lengthy list of reviews and investigations past and present.</p><p>From its fatal safety errors in its electric and gas pipeline business to criminal misdeeds that have led to felony convictions and the utility’s current bankruptcy case, PG&amp;E has been the subject of extensive hand-wringing across California.</p><p>Mr. Newsom has suggested that serious consideration be given to breaking up PG&amp;E, the state’s largest utility company, which serves 16 million customers through is electricity and natural gas operations.</p><p>Much of the company’s future rests in the federal courts, which are overseeing its bankruptcy and some of its criminal proceedings, which are reviewing years of the utility’s actions and its finances.</p><p>PG&amp;E is fighting to emerge from bankruptcy a stronger company but continues to make missteps. Chief among the concerns has been the utility’s wildfire safety program and the handling of victims’ claims after things have gone wrong.</p><p>Tens of thousands of wildfire victims have until Monday to file claims related to two dozen wildfires caused by PG&amp;E’s equipment, or risk losing out on any potential compensation from the utility. That includes the Camp Fire, the most devastating wildfire in California history, suspected of having been caused by a 100-year-old transmission tower that was a quarter-century past its “useful life” by PG&amp;E’s own standards.</p><p>Mr. Johnson and his embattled utility argue that improvements are being made, particularly concerning wildfire prevention. PG&amp;E has been carrying out a series of safety measures, modeled after methods pioneered by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. But some efforts have been stymied by a lack of resources, including a shortage of tree trimmers to clear vegetation around the company’s power lines.</p><p>And after the troubles with the power shut-off, there were renewed calls from homeowners, regulators and the governor for a fundamental review of PG&amp;E’s operations, including its possible breakup.</p><p>Mr. Johnson said in the utility’s response to the utilities commission that the company needed to improve its flow of information to customers as well as its website, which “was a major area of frustration during this event.” He added that the utility was reaching out to communities affected by the power shut-offs, with listening sessions that included county agencies.</p><p>In addition, he said, PG&amp;E has been conducting a detailed review of its actions and is working to enhance information-sharing technology and improve coordination with relevant agencies, notification procedures and operation of its community resource centers.</p><p>“We recognize the hardship that the recent P.S.P.S. event caused for millions of people and want to continue working with all key stakeholders to lessen this burden going forward,” Mr. Johnson said in his letter to the commission. “At the same time, we ask our customers, their families, and our local and state leaders to keep in mind the statistic that matters the most: There were no catastrophic wildfires.”</p><p>But consumer groups like The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, want the courts to take more control of PG&amp;E’s operations, arguing that the recurring troubles at the company show that despite all of Mr. Johnson’s pronouncements, the utility never seems to make significant changes to run a safe and reliable electric system.</p><p>“TURN is renewing our call for the judge in PG&amp;E’s criminal case to put the company in receivership, and to ban PG&amp;E from lobbying and making political contributions,” Mark Toney, TURN’s executive director, said in a statement ahead of the Friday hearing. “It has never been clearer that the managers of PG&amp;E are not to be trusted.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 15:11:21', '2019-10-18 15:11:21', 'pgampe-chief-says-blackout-cannot-become-the-status-quo'),

And when it comes to staring at Twitter on your phone, how much is too much?</p><p>Gadget etiquette is something we are all grappling with, and on this week\'s Tech Tent we hear from two people who have played a big role in shaping the way we interact with technology.</p><p>For Rick Osterloh, Google\'s hardware chief, it has been a big week. Not content with being a huge force in internet search and online advertising, Google has long wanted to be big in hardware.</p><p>It\'s had variable success with everything from the Google Home smart speakers, to virtual reality headsets and the ill-fated Google Glass. But it\'s the Pixel smartphone which is probably the flagship product.</p><p>So far, it\'s won great reviews but quite modest sales, so a lot was riding on this week\'s launch of the Pixel 4.</p><p>When our technology desk editor Leo Kelion interviewed Rick Osterloh he was eager to talk about what he called \"ambient computing\", the idea that our gadgets are all around us but sort of merge into the background except when we need them.</p><p>The new radar feature on the Pixel 4 was an example of this, he explained, allowing you to interact with the phone without touching it.</p><p>\"If you\'re listening to music, you can easily swipe between songs without touching your device. If your alarm goes off in the morning, as you approach it, the alarm sound reduces and then you can swipe to dismiss the alarm. Your phone almost senses a little bit what you want from it.\"</p><p>With a new Google Nest smart speaker also being launched, we are looking at a future where Google is listening to us and sensing us in all sorts of ways.</p><p>Then Leo came up with a question which seemed to stump Mr Osterloh - should a visitor to your home be told that you\'ve got one of these ambient devices before they walk in?</p><p>\"It\'s a great question,\" he said. \"Gosh I haven\'t thought of that.\" But after a moment\'s thought he decided, yes, that would be good gadget etiquette.</p><p>\"Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I mean, I would do when someone enters into my home, and I think it\'s probably something that the products themselves should try to start to indicate.\" He said Nest cameras already signalled their presence.</p><p>But for many of us the problem is not that gadgets are hidden away - but they are in our face all the time because we are addicted to them.</p><p>Nir Eyal\'s career has been all about helping firms get us hooked on gadgets and the services they provide. Indeed, he wrote a book called Hooked, describing the techniques that made products \"sticky\".</p><p>But now he is advising us on how to avoid being constantly distracted by technology. His book Indistractable is full of tips about having a more sensible relationship with your gadgets.</p><p>He rejects the idea that many of us are addicted to our screens: \"The vast majority of us aren\'t addicted, we are distracted, meaning we can do something about it if we try.\"</p><p>He also says that parents may be too focused on screen time as the latest danger to their children\'s wellbeing: \"Whether it was rock and roll in previous generations or rap music or comic books, we want something to blame.\"</p><p>But he says there are plenty of ways we can avoid being distracted, whether it is having rules about phones at the dinner-table or keeping your social media apps off the home screen of your device.</p><p>His key piece of advice, however, is that you should look within yourself to find the reason you cannot ignore those pings and pop-ups from your smartphone:</p><p>\"We turn to these devices as distractions to avoid feeling something we don\'t want to experience -. boredom, loneliness, stress, fatigue, uncertainty.\"</p><p>The last decade has seen huge changes, as smartphones and social media have become integral to our lives.

Officials remain wary as business investment pulls back domestically and economies abroad weaken.</p><p>“Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation,” Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Friday, speaking from prepared remarks in Boston.</p><p>The Fed “will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook,” he said, and “will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.”</p><p>Mr. Clarida’s comments did little to temper market expectations for a coming reduction in interest rates: Investors have nearly fully priced in a quarter-point rate cut at the end of the month. That would lower the federal funds rate to a range between 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Officials avoid surprising markets when possible, because doing so can inadvertently tighten financial conditions and slow borrowing and spending.</p><p>While Mr. Clarida made it clear that the economy is now “in a good place” and the unemployment rate is at a half-century low threats remain.</p><p>Despite some softening around the edges, geopolitical tensions are unresolved. President Trump’s trade war with China may have reached a temporary détente, but the agreement has yet to be finalized and would not roll back the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods that China and America have placed on each others’ products.</p><p>Mr. Trump on Friday increased levies on goods from Europe, and tensions could escalate if he decides next month to place a tariff on imported automobiles.</p><p>In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has managed to negotiate a Brexit deal, lowering the chances of an economically harmful no-deal exit that could have global economic repercussions.

But employment gains have begun to slow and both average hourly earnings and a broader measure of wages and benefits have grown more gradually in recent months, suggesting that business caution may be spilling over.</p><p>Despite mounting warning signs, the housing market is holding up, bolstered by Fed rate cuts in July and September. While overall output growth is slowing, that was expected as stimulus from Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cut fades, and gains remain at or above the economy’s longer-term trend.</p><p>“This is a fluid situation, you’ve got a lot of uncertainty,” Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told reporters on Friday at an event in Washington. Though he does not have a vote on monetary policy, he does sit at the decision-making table.</p><p>He remains “agnostic&quot; about whether a cut is needed this month, he said, and wants to keep the Fed’s options open going forward.</p><p>“This is a fragile time where this could break either way,” he said.</p><p>Recent interest rate decisions have been contentious for Fed officials, as positive current data clash with myriad risks to the outlook. Three members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee dissented from the central bank’s September decision to lower rates, the most of Chair Jerome H. Powell’s tenure.</p><p>Two of the Fed’s regional bank presidents, Kansas City’s Esther George and Boston’s Eric Rosengren, wanted to leave rates unchanged. One, St. Louis’ James Bullard, wanted a sharper cut.</p><p>Those divisions persisted into October. Inflation has remained below the central bank’s 2 percent target, which is increasing some officials’ appetite for additional moves.</p><p>“I think we’ve adjusted things in a pretty good place,” Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told reporters earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported. “Another rate cut would make me more confident that inflation was well positioned to go up to 2 percent, absolutely.”</p><p>But Ms. George has continued to warn that lowering rates could lead to financial excesses and that her current outlook does not call for another cut. She is also keeping an eye on the economic data and risks, however, and hinted in remarks on Friday that she could change her mind.</p><p>“I will remain attentive to the incoming data for signs that downside risks to the outlook materialize in a way that meaningfully affects broad economic conditions,” she said, speaking in Denver. “Under those circumstances, I would be prepared to adjust monetary policy accordingly.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-18 17:32:10', '2019-10-18 17:32:10', 'fed-signals-a-rate-cut-remains-possible-despite-glimmers-of-economic-hope'),

That didn\'t happen. Instead, the union went on strike, silencing GM\'s U.S. factories and costing the company an estimated $2 billion due to lost vehicle production.</p><p>In a tentative deal reached between the two sides, GM agreed to provide longtime workers 3% pay raises in two of the years, with 4% lump sums in the other two. By itself, an $11,000 ratification bonus per worker will cost the company more than a half-billion dollars.</p><p>The deal did nothing to rein in the rising cost of health care; instead it will remain at a 3% premium cost per worker, or about 10% of what most workers in the nation pay. There also are annual profit-sharing checks, a faster path to full pay of more than $32 per hour for workers hired after 2007, and requirements that temporary workers get full-time jobs after three years.</p><p>But the GM of today that must shoulder these costs is in far better shape than the GM of 10 years ago, when the Great Recession caused the near-collapse of the U.S. auto industry. At that time, GM had about 235,000 employees worldwide, including 74,000 U.S. factory workers. Now it has 55,000 fewer employees across the globe, and 24,000 fewer people in U.S. factories.</p><p>A decade ago, the company was dealing with a worldwide financial meltdown that froze credit and auto sales. Gas prices also were high, chasing any remaining buyers away from GM\'s main profit centers in the U.S., pickup trucks and SUVs. Fiat Chrysler also ended up getting bailed out by the government, and Ford survived only because its CEO borrowed billions.</p><p>Now, GM has about $17.5 billion in cash and liquid securities on its balance sheet, which exceeds debt by more than $2 billion. Although its sales fell slightly so far this year, it\'s still making big money on pickup trucks and SUVs in an era of lower gas prices. Last year it announced a restructuring plan that will save that will save an estimated $6 billion per year by the end of 2020. That included closing five U.S. and Canadian factories and letting go of about 8,000 white-collar workers. It also has trimmed engineering and product development costs.</p><p>The company says it can now break even if U.S. sales fall to a range of 10 million to 11 million per year, a rate not seen since the Great Recession. Currently sales are running just under 17 million per year in GM\'s most profitable market.</p><p>The new contract also delivered some wins for GM. Over the UAW\'s objections, it will close three U.S. factories associated with slow-selling car production. The company had wanted to close a fourth, but kept an assembly plant in Detroit alive with a new electric truck.</p><p>The deal includes buyout and retirement incentives for older workers, and while that will be a big one-time cost, it will let the company replace them with lower-paid workers, trimming payroll for at least for a few years, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank.</p><p>Eventually, though, lower-paid workers and temporary hires will have to become full time, adding to costs, Dziczek said. And the company still is stuck with health care costs that are far higher than in other industries.</p><p>\"Those will keep going up every year,\" Morningstar analyst David Whiston said, adding that GM is close to paying $1 billion per year for employee health care. \"It\'s not sustainable how much they are paying for that.\"</p><p>The UAW\'s deal with GM is its first this year, and whatever costs GM winds up with likely will be passed on to Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which still have to go through bargaining.</p><p>And while GM and other automakers may be better position today than a decade ago, they still face significant headwinds. Global auto sales are slowing, including in the U.S., and some economists are predicting another recession as early as next year. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, and he\'s threatened duties on other imported goods including auto parts, all of which will drive up GM\'s costs. A new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is languishing in Congress, and Trump has threatened to scrap the existing treaty if the new one isn\'t passed. That would mean havoc for the auto business with parts now flowing freely to and from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>\"There\'s a high degree of uncertainty,\" says Schuster.</p><p>Although his company sees slightly slowing sales, he\'s not forecasting a recession. He also doesn\'t foresee a return to 2009, when U.S. consumers stopped buying SUVs and trucks.

Suddenly, an application or tax form is kicked back.</p><p>\"And the parents go, \'What are you talking about?\' They don\'t even know what this means,\" says Velasquez, whose nonprofit helps victims of identity theft. \"And ... through no fault of their own, they\'re left holding the bag and they are the ones that are now responsible for cleaning up that mess.\"</p><p>AN IDENTITY THEFT VICTIM AT BIRTH?</p><p>The rise in synthetic identity theft — where criminals piece together a fake consumer — is an unintended consequence of Social Security number \"randomization,\" which was initiated in 2011 to expand the pool of available numbers, she says.</p><p>Old Social Security numbers had clues to geography and birth dates in the digits. Randomizing the numbers made it harder for scammers to guess them — but also made it harder for creditors to spot the bogus use of a Social Security number on an application.</p><p>Before randomization, criminals typically purchased minors\' Social Security numbers on the black market or tracked down the numbers of dead children. But now, sometimes the number \"is just completely made up,\" Velasquez says. Fraud-detection measures used previously have become ineffective because it\'s no longer possible to pair a Social Security number with a location or approximate age.</p><p>Criminals often start with a not-yet-issued Social Security number to create a fake identity. If it works, the number becomes attached to a credit file for a consumer who doesn\'t exist.</p><p>HOW THE NUMBER GETS IN THE CREDIT SYSTEM</p><p>\"You can create a credit file with almost nothing,\" says Adam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout, a company offering identity theft education and resolution services. When a credit card application with a previously unused Social Security number arrives, a new credit file is started based on the information in that application.</p><p>The thief often starts small, say, with a card marketed to credit newbies, then builds on that to get more accounts with bigger credit limits. Then, they suddenly max out all the accounts — a \"bust-out\" scheme — and walk away, leaving the accounts to go to collections and never to be paid. The child\'s credit reputation is left in tatters, but that\'s often not discovered until the child is old enough to apply for credit, by seeking a college loan, for example.</p><p>Velasquez says the solution lies in creating a process where financial institutions and other credit grantors can verify an applicant\'s name and number with the Social Security Administration for identity confirmation. That\'s in the works, she says.</p><p>IT\'S ESSENTIAL TO FREEZE CREDIT</p><p>In the meantime, the best protection is to freeze kids\' credit . While it\'s possible parents will discover that a child\'s Social Security number has already been used to build a synthetic identity, chances are it hasn\'t. (If it has, the sooner you clean up the mess , the better.)</p><p>Freezing a child\'s credit can prevent their Social Security number from being used to open bogus credit accounts. Both Levin and Velasquez say they \"absolutely\" recommend freezing a newborn\'s credit.</p><p>The mechanics are relatively simple. Parents will need to make and send copies of documents, including birth certificates, Social Security cards and government-issued identification, to each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.</p><p>Go online to Equifax and Experian to print out request forms to complete and mail in with the required copies of documents. The mailing address is on each form. TransUnion doesn\'t have an online form; instead, to request a freeze, write a letter and send document copies to TransUnion, P.O. Box 380, Woodlyn, PA 19094.</p><p>Each credit bureau will send confirmation of the freeze, as well as a personal identification number. The PINs will be needed to unfreeze the credit file, so it\'s essential to keep that information and store it in a secure place.</p><p>\"Even if it is a little difficult, this is what parents should be doing,\" Levin says about freezing kids\' credit.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

But enthusiasm varies among U.A.W. members.', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/business/18jpmotors1-print/18motors1-facebookJumbo.jpg', '<p>The tentative contract hammered out by the United Automobile Workers and General Motors won’t please all of the union’s members, but it is sure to get strong support at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant.</p><p>The factory, which employs 700 U.A.W. members, is scheduled to close in January. But under the contract, G.M. has promised to spend $3 billion to retool Hamtramck to make battery modules and electric trucks, most likely increasing its work force and ensuring its operation for at least several more years.</p><p>“I think it’s a good contract,” Wiley Turnage, chairman of Local 22, which represents Hamtramck workers, said Friday. “I’m happy.” He said he planned to vote in favor of the contract and to recommend that his members do the same.</p><p>If ratified by the U.A.W.’s rank and file, the contract will end a strike that has idled 34 factories in seven states for more than a month and has cost G.M. an estimated $2 billion in operating profit. The walkout’s effects have rippled through the North American auto industry, affecting production and idling workers at parts suppliers and G.M.’s operations in Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Voting on the contract will take place next week, with a result due on Friday. A simple majority is required for ratification, but it must include a majority of skilled-trades workers — the electricians and other technical specialists who maintain machinery. If it does not, the union will have to bargain with the company to address their concerns — as occurred in 2015, the last time G.M. negotiated a contract.</p><p>The agreement includes provisions for higher wages and a process that allows temporary workers to become full-fledged employees. It also enables full-time hourly workers to rise to the top wage of $32 an hour within four years, ending a two-tier wage system that fostered tensions between workers. Each worker would also be paid a bonus of $11,000.</p><p>RBC Capital Markets estimated that the contract would raise G.M.’s labor costs by $100 million a year.</p><p>For its part, G.M. secured the union’s acceptance that three plants already idled, including a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, will close permanently. That will help G.M. guard against excess manufacturing capacity at a time when auto sales are slowing, and put G.M. in a more stable position if the economy goes into a recession. The union went into the talks hoping to prod G.M. into reactivating the Lordstown plant.</p><p>A rejection of the contract would be a major setback for the U.A.W. president, Doug Jones, and the union’s other senior officials at a delicate moment. Before the strike, union leaders had come under heavy criticism from the rank and file over a federal corruption investigation in which several high-ranking officers have been charged with using union funds for lavish travel and personal purchases.</p><p>Many union locals have started planning informational meetings to explain the terms of the contract to members. Darlene Maddox, who was laid off when the Lordstown factory closed this year and accepted a transfer to Lansing, Mich., said she was very disappointed that her old plant wouldn’t be saved but wanted to know more before deciding how to vote.</p><p>“My first instinct is to vote no,” she said. “But the major highlights appear to be good.”</p><p>Others said they were encouraged that temporary workers would be able to become permanent employees with full benefits after three years of service.</p><p>Under current rules, temporary workers earn about $15 an hour, can be laid off at any time and have no dental or vision insurance.</p><p>Linda Castro, a temporary worker at a plant making sport utility vehicles in Spring Hill, Tenn., joined G.M. in January 2017, was laid off after a few months and more than a year later was recalled. She said she was worried that G.M. would lay off temporary workers before they could become full employees.</p><p>“No one is going to make it to three years,” she said. “So it’s useless.”</p><p>Others said the end of the two-tier wage system was a big victory.

They argue that the government\'s plans are based on inaccurate readings and calculations by the government-funded National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The institute disputed that in a statement, calling its nitrogen measuring \"robust and scientifically responsible.\"</p><p>The farmers started their demonstration at the central city of De Bilt, where the institute has its headquarters, before heading to The Hague.</p><p>There, they gathered around a small stage to listen to music and speeches from farmers and politicians.

Not after aviation regulators deem the Max safe.</p><p>However, airlines are likely to be more flexible in letting passengers change their schedules to avoid flying on a Max, at least for a while.</p><p>\"We will take care of customers who are not comfortable flying on the Max. We will rebook them,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein. The airline won\'t charge those passengers the standard $200 fee for changing a ticket, he said.</p><p>It\'s unclear how long that flexibility will last. Airlines are likely to gauge media coverage and passenger sentiment about the Max. Once the plane recedes from the news and customer confidence grows, airlines could go back to their regular policies around canceling and changing flights.</p><p>Also, while they will be willing to rebook passengers free of charge for a while, that doesn\'t mean that American, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines — the three U.S. carriers that fly the Max — can get you on the next flight. They are under no obligation to find a seat for you on another carrier, or to pay for a hotel room if they don\'t have an available seat until the next day.</p><p>\"If passengers go to the airport and decide not to fly because the flight is going to be operated by a Max, they will not be able to get compensation because it will be their own decision to cancel their trip, it will not be the decision of the airline,\" said Chrystel Erotokritou, who tracks compensation for AirHelp, a company that offers to help passengers with airline-service problems.</p><p>And if the airline offers to put the customer on a flight three days later, \"there isn\'t much the passenger can do,\" Erotokritou said. \"Either they fly with the Max or they cancel their trip, because when the (Max) comes back into service, it will mean that the aviation authorities in the U.S. and the E.U. now consider this aircraft to be perfectly safe.\"</p><p>It is safe to assume that most airline passengers have no idea what model of plane they are booked on, or whether it is a Boeing, an Airbus, or something else. Even after they board the plane.</p><p>American, Southwest and United Airlines, the three U.S. carriers that own Max jets, display the type of plane for every flight on their online schedules.</p><p>However, airlines routinely swap planes when there is a mechanical issue with one, or when an incoming plane is arriving too late. That means travelers who carefully checked the airline website to make sure they weren\'t buying a ticket on a Max could wind up on one anyway, with no advance warning.</p><p>If that happens, consumer advocates say passengers should talk to the gate agent immediately.</p><p>\"You should indicate that you\'re fearful of this plane and it would be better for everybody if they allow you to take another flight or give you a credit or a refund,\" said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, an advocacy group that sprung from protests over long ground delays during which passengers were trapped on planes. \"You don\'t want a flyer who is panicked and causing problems on the flight.\"</p><p>Aware of this situation, American and United say they will not use the Max as a last-minute substitute for other planes, although it\'s not clear how long they will stick to that policy.</p><p>Gary Leff, who writes a popular travel blog called View from the Wing, thinks airlines will have to notify passengers waiting for the plane if a substitution means their flight will use a Max.</p><p>\"I think there will be announcements — people will know they are getting on a Max, especially in the case of an aircraft substitution,\" Leff said. Airline officials, he said, \"don\'t want customers freaking out after pushback (from the gate) or after takeoff.\"</p><p>American, Southwest and United said they are still finishing details for the return of the Max and how to communicate with customers. When the time comes, they will stress that the plane will have been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Tony Roach, Southwest\'s managing director of customer experience, said the airline will highlight the software upgrades and additional pilot training that will be required before the Max is recertified. United spokesman Frank Benenati said the airline \"will be transparent — and communicate in advance — with our customers who are booked to fly on a Max.\" Feinstein, the American spokesman, said his airline\'s pilots will assure customers that the plane is safe.</p><p>Of course, there is one fail-safe strategy for travelers who are determined to avoid the Boeing plane: \"If you really want to be absolutely sure, you can fly on an airline that doesn\'t have any MAXes,\" said Hudson, the passenger advocate.</p><p>Delta Air Lines is the largest U.S. carrier that has never used the Max, and its CEO said last week Delta benefitted over the summer from the thousands of Max-related cancellations at Southwest, American and United.</p><p>It is still unclear when the Max will fly again. Boeing began working on updating the plane\'s flight software shortly after the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet off the coast of Indonesia. When the plane was grounded after the second crash — an Ethiopian Airlines Max went down near Addis Ababa after takeoff on March 10 — Boeing was optimistic that it could complete the software work in a few weeks.</p><p>That work stretched out over three months, then FAA test pilots found another problem in which computers on the plane could fail.
