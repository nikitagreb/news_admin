Apple Could Be Next.', 'Pro-democracy demonstrators have begun singling out companies that they consider enemies of their movement. Vandalism and calls for boycotts have followed.', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/business/15hk-boycott-1/15hk-boycott-1-facebookJumbo.jpg', '<p>HONG KONG — One company is the world’s largest coffee chain. Another runs a Japanese restaurant empire. A third makes some of the most popular online games on the planet.</p><p>The global businesses — Starbucks, Yoshinoya and Activision Blizzard — would seem far removed from the political discontent in Hong Kong. But to some of the pro-democracy protesters there, and a growing number of their global allies, the companies are seen, rightly or wrongly, as sympathizers with the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, and as legitimate targets for boycotts or even vandalism.</p><p>Protesters are documenting what they see as the companies’ ties to China, then circulating the information on mobile apps and websites — sometimes based on mere rumor, or on comments made by executives or their family members. Starbucks and Yoshinoya have been repeatedly targeted because of the owner of their Hong Kong franchises, while Activision Blizzard, the maker of World of Warcraft, has been subject to boycotts for attempting to censor a pro-democracy player in Hong Kong.</p><p>The monthslong protests and their fraught politics are rippling overseas, ensnaring an ever wider range of corporations and executives, no matter their nationality. All have spent years cultivating their brands, but now find their reputations in jeopardy over any suggestion that they don’t support the protesters.</p><p>Some companies are in the awkward position of trying to dodge questions about the issue, to avoid offending either China, with its vast market, or Hong Kong activists, who have fervent support among Westerners and Taiwanese. After a single recent tweet, the N.B.A. found itself caught between both sides.</p><p>“All corporations here are walking on eggshells when it comes to what they say, whether it’s about Hong Kong or about the mainland,” said David Webb, a shareholder activist in Hong Kong.</p><p>The companies’ vulnerabilities are growing, as activists turn increasingly to vandalism and to boycotts. And Hong Kong’s reputation as a hub of freewheeling capitalism, with one of the world’s most business-friendly environments, is already suffering. These days, workers regularly sweep up glass from shops with broken windows, as shuttered storefronts with graffiti sit in the shadows of gleaming skyscrapers.</p><p>Last weekend, protesters called for rallies in shopping malls and a boycott of allegedly pro-China restaurants and stores — with a small, hard-core contingent encouraging the “renovating” (smashing) or “decorating” (spray-painting graffiti) of those locations.</p><p>At a Starbucks branch in the Tseung Kwan O district, a few protesters used hammers and a fire extinguisher to smash glass shelves, while others threw plates and trays on the ground. “The heavens will destroy the Communist Party” was spray-painted on a counter.</p><p>Activists called for protests at Apple stores after the company removed an app, HKmap.live, from its App Store that showed the locations of police officers in real time. But there have not been attacks on Apple stores yet.</p><p>Apple has enormous business interests in China, which is its third biggest market after the United States and Europe, and the decision to remove the app was criticized by pro-democracy activists and lawmakers. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the app was removed because people were using it to track down officers to attack them or pinpoint sites to target when the police were not present.</p><p>Some protesters have attacked subway stations, including with Molotov cocktails. Many believe the MTR Corporation, the company that operates the subway, has been working with local officials to undermine protests by shutting down some stations, ending service early and, once, closing the entire system.</p><p>“The outbreak of vandalism or violence in an operating station will endanger the safety of other passengers and MTR staff,” the company said in explaining the closures.</p><p>“When I see people destroying public facilities and stores, I feel pained because you still need money to repair it,” said Michelle Tang, a 40-year-old sales worker. “I want it to be peaceful and free again,” she said of Hong Kong. “Now I wouldn’t dare say anything if people were smashing glass around me.”</p><p>Many activists accuse undercover police officers of carrying out some acts of vandalism to tarnish the image of the mostly peaceful movement.</p><p>As the movement settles into a prolonged campaign, activists are systematically pushing for broader boycotts.</p><p>One group developed an app, WhatsGap, that tells residents which restaurants to patronize and which ones to avoid. The ones considered friendly to the protests appear on a map of Hong Kong marked in yellow, while those considered hostile have a black marker. The developers plan to add shops.</p><p></p><p>“For a lot of people not on the front line, these are things they can do,” said Alison Yung, 36, an events planner, who backs the protests. “They can support the movement this way.”</p><p>At universities, students are handing out cards with lists of businesses to boycott and staging sit-ins at establishments on campus. Twice last month, people occupied the cafeteria of S.H. Ho College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><p>The cafeteria’s caterer is Maxim’s Group, which is also the franchise owner of Starbucks in Hong Kong. Maxim’s has drawn the ire of activists because the founder’s daughter, Annie Wu Suk-ching, said last month in a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council that the protesters were “rioters” who did not represent Hong Kong.</p><p>Maxim’s released a statement saying that Ms. Wu had no position at the company, and that it hoped “all parties” in the ongoing political conflict “will resolve their differences.”</p><p>Starbucks did not answer an email request for comment.</p><p>Yoshinoya also got the attention of activists when its Hong Kong executives fired an advertising agency that created a post on the restaurant’s Facebook page mocking the police. Hop Hing Group, which operates Yoshinoya in Hong Kong, did not return a call seeking comment.</p><p>The chief executive of Best Mart 360, a local convenience store chain, was accused of having ties to gangs from Fujian Province in mainland China that have clashed with protesters. (Best Mart 360 has denied any such ties.)</p><p>McDonald’s presents a dilemma for the movement. The chain is ubiquitous in Hong Kong (and open 24 hours), and some people have shown their support for the protesters by buying them McDonald’s coupons, to keep them going through the long demonstrations. But some activists have pointed out that McDonald’s sold an 80 percent stake in its China and Hong Kong business in 2017 to a private equity group comprised of Citic, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, and the Carlyle Group, based in New York.</p><p>International support for the protests has made the issue harder for companies to navigate.</p><p>Last week, the Chinese government punished the N.B.A. after Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a tweet in support of the protests. After the league distanced itself from Mr. Morey, some Americans began showing up at games with “Free Hong Kong” posters and banners, and members of Congress chastised the N.B.A.</p><p>Activision Blizzard faced a similar backlash after it suspended an e-sports player in Hong Kong, Chung Ng Wai, for voicing support for the movement during a live broadcast. It forced the player, who goes by the name Blitzchung, to forfeit a reported $10,000 in prize money. Many gamers called for a boycott of the company; dozens of Blizzard employees staged a walkout in protest at the company’s California headquarters; and members of Congress spoke up, too.</p><p>Blizzard said last Friday it would restore the prize money to Mr. Chung and reduce his suspension to six months, while asserting that the company’s relationship with China had not played a role in the original decision.</p><p>Whether the backlash against global brands will result in financial damage is unclear. Some actions taken by the protesters may not have much effect by themselves.</p><p>For example, protesters have been calling for a boycott of Cathay Pacific because the airline, under pressure from Beijing, has fired or punished employees who are part of the movement. But for anyone who wants to fly directly from Hong Kong to a Chinese city, it is impossible in most cases to avoid taking either Cathay or a Chinese state-owned airline. Flights between Hong Kong and mainland China are emptier than usual these days not because of a boycott, but because many Chinese want to avoid the protests.</p><p>Some activists have made mistakes in choosing which businesses to target. That was the case with Shanghai Commercial Bank. Activists vandalized at least one branch, apparently thinking the chain was based in mainland China.</p><p>But the bank is based in Hong Kong. Its motto is “serving the community.”</p><p>Tiffany May contributed reporting.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:17:18', '2019-10-15 19:17:18'),

And bankers are starting to worry.</p><p>“Of course there’s a recession ahead — what we don’t know is if it’s going to happen soon,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said during a call on Tuesday with journalists to discuss the bank’s third-quarter earnings.</p><p>Even as his bank announced record-high revenue, Mr. Dimon warned that the strong position of consumers in the United States had come under pressure from “increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade.”</p><p>The warning was new: Just six months ago, during another discussion of the bank’s earnings, Mr. Dimon had predicted that United States economic growth “could go on for years.”</p><p>“We’ll just have to wait and see,” he said on Tuesday.</p><p>JPMorgan’s quarterly earnings were no worse for wear. The bank took in a record $29.3 billion during the third quarter and earned $2.68 per share, beating analysts’ expectations by 23 cents. Its deposits grew by 3 percent compared with the same period last year.</p><p>The report from Goldman Sachs, which also announced third-quarter results, along with Citigroup and Wells Fargo, was less rosy. The bank’s net earnings of just under $1.9 billion for the quarter were 26 percent lower than the same period last year and 22 percent lower than the second quarter of 2019. Goldman also announced that it had set aside $291 million for credit losses, a 67 percent increase from last year.</p><p>The bank’s chief executive, David Solomon, shrugged off some of the recent turmoil on Wall Street, which has included disappointing debuts by tech companies like Uber and botched initial public offerings like WeWork, saying he believed the I.P.O. market was in fact healthy. But, he said, the bank is closely watching “where we are in the economic cycle” as it manages risks across the firm.</p><p>Citigroup’s chief financial officer, Mark Mason, said on a call with journalists that the bank had begun making adjustments to its business operations to accommodate changing economic conditions.</p><p>“We’ve been very thoughtful about the pacing of our hiring,” he said.</p><p>Citigroup’s revenue was $18.6 billion, slightly lower than the previous quarter but a bit higher than its third-quarter revenue a year ago. But its corporate lending revenue decreased by 6 percent from a year earlier.</p><p>Citigroup’s business customers have been showing “pause,” Mr. Mason said, “in terms of whether they actually want to invest in building out facilities or operations, pause in terms of whether they want to consider entering into new markets.”</p><p>That was a subtle but significant admission that the slowdown was affecting Citigroup’s business.</p><p>The bank’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, had been saying for months that its global footprint allowed it to take advantage of shifting trade routes so that the president’s tariffs did not actually hurt the bank. He offered a more troubled view on Tuesday during a call with analysts.</p><p>“It has caused a slowdown in terms of trade,” Mr. Corbat said of the trade war. “If we could start to get some clarity on some of these things, where I think businesses can have some more surety on the future, our trade business would definitely benefit from that.”</p><p>Wells Fargo reported $22 billion in revenue for the quarter, slightly more than the $21.9 billion it generated in the same three months a year ago, and said it had $50 million left over from what it had set aside for loan losses in the most recent quarter.</p><p>And the bank’s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, pointed to a different concern that was closer to home for his business clients. “To date, while our customers are cautious, the most common concern they identify is their ability to hire enough qualified workers,” he said on a call with analysts.</p><p>Wells Fargo, the country’s fourth-largest bank, is still operating under growth restrictions imposed by its regulators, and its per-share earnings of 92 cents were lower than analysts’ expectations because of expenses from legal woes stemming from a series of scandals that began to come to light in 2016.</p><p>The bank has continued to stumble lately. Its chief executive stepped down suddenly in March not long after lawmakers grilled him over lingering problems, and The New York Times reported in August that customers whose accounts had been closed were still being charged fees for activity after the closing date. The bank’s interim chief executive, C. Allen Parker, told analysts that Wells Fargo was still looking into the matter.</p><p>The bank’s new chief executive, Charles W. Scharf, starts next week.</p><p>Wells Fargo reported a $1.6 billion charge for legal expenses related to “one of the largest lingering issues related to sales practices,” Mr. Shrewsberry said, but he declined to go into details.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:18:19', '2019-10-15 19:18:19'),

But tariffs could have a psychological effect.', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/business/15turkeyecon-sub/15turkeyecon-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg', '<p>FRANKFURT — Doubling tariffs on Turkish steel imports, as President Trump said he would do Monday, might make investors nervous. But it would take a much broader attack on the economy of Turkey to restrain its tanks from moving deeper into Syria, analysts say.</p><p>The reason is simple: Tariffs approved last year by White House officials have already gutted Turkey’s exports to the United States. They can hardly go any lower.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s threat to cut off talks on what he called a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey isn’t expected to have much of an effect, either. The figure was, to put it mildly, aspirational. Current two-way trade between Turkey and the United States is only about $21 billion.</p><p>Because neither American nor Turkish officials had detailed how they would more than quadruple trade, “analysts did not expect any immediate favorable impact on the Turkish economy,” said Selva Demiralp, economics professor at Koc University in Istanbul. “Thus, the withdrawal of this deal should not have much of an impact, either.”</p><p>The measures announced by the president are unlikely to destroy the Turkish economy, as he has warned, but plenty of other existing threats could. Economists have long regarded Turkey as a bubble waiting to burst because of government mismanagement, an inflated building boom and a shaky currency. Turkey’s military incursion into Kurdish-controlled northern Syria has unsettled investors who already had concerns about the region’s stability.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s tariff threat does give investors yet another reason to be apprehensive.</p><p>“The sanctions are ineffective, and they know they are ineffective,” said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management in Luxembourg. But he added: “Tariffs frighten both businesses and consumers. They save more and invest less because they are afraid of the future. The impact on expectations can be quite considerable.”</p><p>If the president really wanted to hurt Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Galy said, he would take steps to make it difficult for Turkish commercial banks and the central bank to conduct transactions in dollars.</p><p>The White House also said Monday that it would impose sanctions on several top officials in Ankara, including the defense and energy ministers and their ministries, essentially severing them from the global financial system. Mr. Trump’s executive order allows the sanctions to be expanded to other officials or government entities.</p><p>But comprehensive financial sanctions against the Turkish government would be seen as extremely hostile considering Turkey is still nominally a NATO ally.</p><p>Turmoil in Turkey has already caused the German carmaker Volkswagen to reconsider a big investment there. The company said Tuesday that it had postponed plans to build a $1.7 billion factory in the western part of the country that would employ 4,000 people and produce 300,000 Volkswagen and Skoda vehicles a year.</p><p>“We are monitoring the current situation with great concern,” Volkswagen said in a statement, without elaborating.</p><p>A nightmare for the Turkish government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would be a plunge in the value of the lira. That would cause the prices of imported goods to spike, fuel inflation inside Turkey and undermine popular support for Mr. Erdogan.</p><p>On Tuesday, the lira slipped about 0.6 percent versus the dollar, a relatively small amount for an often volatile currency. Analysts assume that the Turkish central bank and state-controlled commercial banks are using their dollar reserves to buy liras in the market and prevent a steeper decline.</p><p>Eventually, though, the central bank will run out of dollars. The longer Turkey continues fighting in Syria, the greater the stress on the Turkish currency, analysts say.</p><p>“History suggests that geopolitical tensions, especially involving the U.S., are not kind to the lira,” analysts at Oxford Economics said in a note to clients on Tuesday.</p><p>The Turkish steel industry is feeling plenty of pain without any help from the United States. Production is down 10 percent this year, said Ugur Dalbeler, a member of the board of the Turkish Steel Exporters Association and chief executive of Colakoglu Metalurji, a steel producer based in Istanbul.</p><p>“It is tough,” Mr. Dalbeler said by phone from Mexico, where he was attending an industry gathering.</p><p>Turkish steel makers have been slammed from numerous directions. Customers in the Middle East have suffered from tensions in the region. Europe has restricted steel imports in response to a glut in global supply. Demand from Japan, another important customer, has slumped. United States tariffs are, by comparison, a small problem.</p><p>Mr. Dalbeler expressed anger that the tariffs, originally justified on national security grounds, were being used to put pressure on Turkey.</p><p>“Doubling tariffs again proves that the president is not using his authority for national security,” he said. “He’s using it against Turkey politically.”</p><p>The United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Turkish steel last year amid a dispute over a detained American pastor. The Trump administration cut the tariffs to 25 percent in May, to the same level as tariffs imposed on most other foreign producers. But the damage was already done.</p><p>From January through August, imports of Turkish steel by the United States plunged 80 percent to 136,000 tons, “which is nothing, basically, on a global scale,” said Alex Griffiths, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm.</p><p>“Exports were already to the level where I wouldn’t consider the United States to be a major export destination,” Mr. Griffiths said.</p><p>Mr. Trump mentioned the $100 billion trade deal with Turkey during a news conference with Mr. Erdogan in Japan in June. After Mr. Erdogan said the goal was to expand trade to $75 billion a year, Mr. Trump said that was too low.</p><p>“I think the $75 billion is small,” he said, according to an official transcript. “I think it’s going to be well over $100 billion soon.”</p><p>In September, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross acknowledged during a visit to Ankara that “$100 billion sounds like a lot.” But he added that it would be less than 2 percent of the United States’ total trade.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:19:21', '2019-10-15 19:19:21'),

The bank paid $16 million in August to settle accusations by the S.E.C. of misconduct in China and Russia.</p><p>Josef Ackerman, who was the bank’s C.E.O. until 2012, denied having knowledge of many details in the documents, but defended the broader strategy. “This was part of doing business in this country,” he told the NYT.</p><h2>LeBron James slams Houston Rockets executive’s Hong Kong tweet</h2><p>Mr. James said that a tweet by Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets’ general manager, in support of the Hong Kong protests was “misinformed,” Scott Cacciola of the NYT reports. It was a notable comment by an N.B.A. star that toed Beijing’s line.</p><p>Mr. James said he believed that Mr. Morey “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand,” and that “many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.” His reaction came after the L.A. Lakers played a pair of preseason games in China.</p><p>His comments thrust the N.B.A.’s approach to the tweet back into the spotlight. Though the league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, has defended Mr. Morey’s right to express his views, several stars have tread carefully to avoid offending China, where they have big business interests through sponsors like Nike.</p><p>A backlash on social media soon followed. Among those weighing in was Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, who wrote: “It’s sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China &amp; putting profits over human rights for #HongKong.”</p><p>More: China’s censorship has international consequences.</p><h2>It’s earnings season. Investors are bracing for turmoil.</h2><p>Wall Street is kicking off third-quarter earnings reports today with announcements from JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. And corporate America has given less guidance during the quarter than usual, meaning that investors don’t have many clues on what to expect.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 companies have offered the fewest quarterly updates — positive or negative — since 2000, according to Bank of America. “Companies are starting to do what they do when there is rampant uncertainty, which is just stop issuing guidance,” Savita Subramanian, the head of U.S. equity strategy at the bank, told Matt Phillips of the NYT.</p><p>Companies may be feeling uncertain over a slowing economy, the trade war and presidential politics.</p><p>“The relative silence since their last reports means stock investors may be in for a lot of bad news all at once,” Mr. Phillips writes. (FactSet estimates that earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline 4.6 percent for the quarter.)</p><h2>Does WeWork favor more debt over diluting investors?</h2><p>Executives of the co-working company reportedly favor a financial bailout plan led by JPMorgan Chase to a proposal that would hand control over to its biggest investor, SoftBank, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources. They’ll have to make a decision this week on which proposal to take.</p><p>JPMorgan is said to be sounding out potential buyers for a debt-financing plan that could add billions of dollars to the company, Bloomberg reports. The structure of the offering could change based on investor feedback, though the news service adds that it may include some bonds whose interest would be paid out in additional bonds.</p><p>Any financing would probably carry high interest rates. Bloomberg reports that the pay-in-kind notes could feature a punitive 15 percent coupon.</p><p>Others think the SoftBank plan is a bad idea — for SoftBank and its founder, Masa Son. A takeover of WeWork “goes beyond doubling-down on a flailing investment in a single company and would saddle Son’s team with a task the fund wasn’t set up to tackle,” Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion writes.</p><p>And WeWork has another problem: formaldehyde in its phone booths. The company told customers that it was removing about 1,600 booths in U.S. and Canadian locations that may have elevated levels of the chemical.</p><h2>Turkey isn’t heeding Trump’s threat of sanctions</h2><p>President Trump said yesterday that he would put sanctions on Turkish government agencies and officials after Turkey invaded northern Syria.

That\'s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.</p><p>The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.</p><p>Trump\'s reference to a \"fraudulent speech\" comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president\'s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>Schiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character.\"</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.</p><p>The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.</p><p>———</p><p>SYRIA and TURKEY</p><p>TRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \"I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\'t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged...down.\" — tweets Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: That\'s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.</p><p>Both Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.</p><p>Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\'s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don\'t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.</p><p>Some of Turkey\'s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Thursday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat.</p><p>IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\' self-declared caliphate.</p><p>Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.</p><p>U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \"eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\"</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\'t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.</p><p>The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.</p><p>As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ...including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Most of them came from Europe.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.</p><p>Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.</p><p>Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.</p><p>———</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\'s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \"they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\" — tweet Wednesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.</p><p>Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Monday on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel didn\'t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Monday on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:25:10', '2019-10-15 19:25:10'),

In a statement announcing his removal, Blizzard said they were banning player Blitzchung for violating its competition rules by engaging in an act that \"offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\"</p><p>Both cases have illustrated the difficulty of navigating China\'s lucrative market.</p><p>Before the controversial tweet, the Rockets were one of the most beloved teams in China. On Oct 4., its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. While the tweet was quickly deleted, the backlash was swift. Within a few days, China\'s state-run broadcasting network ordered a blackout of NBA coverage. China\'s internet giant Tencent, which inked a five-year, $1.5 billion deal in August to stream NBA games in China, also announced that they will not play Rockets games.</p><p>Morey has apologized, and the Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said that Morey does not speak for them. Rockets players James Harden and Russell Westbrook apologized at a news conference, with Harden adding, \"We love China, we love playing there.\"</p><p>1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.</p><p>On Wednesday, President Donald Trump weighed in, telling reporters outside the White House that “the NBA knows what they are doing,” when asked with he thought about the situation.</p><p>Trump then attacked Golden State Warriors’ coach Steve Kerr, referencing a recent news conference when Kerr called the situation “a really bizarre international story” that a lot of us “don’t know what to make of.”</p><p>“I watched this guy, Steve Kerr, he was so scared. He was like a little boy, he didn\'t know how to answer the question and he was shaking,” Trump said.</p><p>He also took aim at Gregg Popovich, coach of the San Antonio Spurs, accusing Popovich and Kerr of “pandering to China.”</p><p>The fallout from the tweet also continued in China. On Wednesday, video spread on social media of an NBA banner being ripped off the side of a building in Shanghai.</p><p>The NBA said that it was not its decision to call off Wednesday\'s NBA Cares event with the Lakers, which was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics. On Tuesday, a separate NBA Cares event with the Brooklyn Nets at a school in Shanghai was also called off by the Chinese government. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that they would still donate computers to the education center as planned, according to ESPN.</p><p>In a statement announcing their decision to suspend plans to broadcast a series of NBA preseason games, China\'s state-owned broadcasting network CCTV said it is \"strongly dissatisfied and opposed\" to Silver\'s \"claim to support Morey\'s free expression of rights.\"</p><p>\"We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\" the statement added. \"To this end, CCTV Sports Channel of the Central Radio and Television General Administration decided to immediately suspend the current broadcast arrangements of the NBA preseason [China Games] and immediately investigate all cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA.\"</p><p>As the NBA is still reeling from the fallout, the world of esports was rocked by a separate scandal after a high-profile gamer from Hong Kong spoke out in support of the anti-government demonstrations in an interview -- and then was abruptly banned from the competition.</p><p>Ng Wai Chung, known by his gaming handle \"Blitzchung,\" was banned from the platform Blizzard, where he was competing in a Hearthstone tournament, after a post-game interview supporting protesters in Hong Kong. In a statement announcing his removal, Blizzard said they were banning Blitzchung for violating its competition rules by engaging in an act that \"offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, #BoycottBlizard was trending on Twitter in the U.S. Chung has not publicly responded to the news, but his Twitter bio was updated to read that he was \"banned\" as a grandmaster and states: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\"</p><p>The move drew bipartisan criticism from lawmakers on Twitter.</p><p>“Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a tweet. “No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.”</p><p>Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.

No final trade agreement has been reached.</p><p>It\'s true that U.S. and China declared a temporary truce in their 15-month trade war. As part of a cease-fire deal announced Friday, China agreed to buy up to $50 billion in U.S. farm products, while the Trump administration said it would suspend a tariff increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday.</p><p>However, negotiators reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed. A final deal could still fall through, though Trump told reporters Friday he didn\'t think that would happen.</p><p>Many of the details remained to be worked out. Some of the thorniest issues — such as U.S. allegations that China forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets — were dealt with only partially, or not at all, and will require further talks.</p><p>\"The president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven\'t,\" said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p><p>The administration still has in place tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing has lashed back by taxing about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on soybeans and other agricultural products.</p><p>Meanwhile, the threat of escalation still hangs over the two countries. Trump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs that are set to take effect Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products — a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>SYRIA and TURKEY</p><p>TRUMP: \"We were supposed to be there for 30 days and we\'ve been there for 10 years.\" — remarks Saturday at the Values Voter summit.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago.\" — tweet on Oct. 7.</p><p>THE FACTS: Previous administrations had never indicated a specific timeline for U.S. involvement in Syria , let alone set a limit of 30 days.</p><p>The first American ground troops entered Syria in late 2015, initially 50 and eventually growing to about 2,000, to recruit, organize and advise thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters and push IS out of most of its strongholds.

Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. ... So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\'t think so.\" — Minneapolis rally Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\'s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, George Mesires, wrote in an internet post Sunday that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time \"based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.\"</p><p>\"To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\'s board of directors,\" Mesires said, referring to the fund. \"He has not received any return on his investment.\"</p><p>Trump\'s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\'s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.</p><p>Hunter Biden said Sunday that he will step down from the Chinese board at the end of the month as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the presidency.</p><p>———</p><p>IMPEACHMENT</p><p>TRUMP: \"We released a perfect conversation. ...I will say this: Adam Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation.

What he did is criminal.\" — remarks Friday to reporters.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Congressman Adam Schiff, who when seeing the REAL Ukraine phone call Transcript decided he\'d better make up one of his own.\" — tweet Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Which is it? Did Schiff characterize the phone call before or after the White House memo describing the conversation came out? As far as the timeline goes, Trump was right the second time. But Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said nothing criminal.</p><p>Trump is referring to remarks the California Democrat made at a Sept. 26 committee hearing, when Schiff mocked the president\'s pleas to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. The White House memo of that July 25 call was released one day before.</p><p>During the hearing, Schiff offered an exaggerated performance of that rough transcript. He said his remarks reflected the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character\" and were meant as parody.</p><p>There\'s no question of criminality in what Schiff said. Lawmakers are given wide protections from liability for comments made in the course of Congress under the \"speech or debate\" clause in the Constitution, which seeks to foster political debate.</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics and invents dialogue that he attributes to them; Schiff did similar in his remarks.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>TRUMP, on Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ...

So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office.

Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Oct. 7 on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet on Oct. 7, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel\'s statement relies on an op-ed by conservative commentator Stephen Moore that obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what was claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Oct. 7 on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:26:15', '2019-10-15 19:26:15'),

The casualty counts were climbing, with dozens dead, more missing and some 100 people injured in Nagano, Fukushima, Miyagi and other central and northern prefectures.</p><p>At least 10 Shinkansen trains, each consisting of 12 cars, were damaged by the flooding at a depot in Nagano, said East Japan Railway Co. spokesman Yuji Ishikawa.</p><p>Evacuation orders were still in effect, so details were still unclear. But electronic equipment underneath the carriages was likely totally wrecked, he said.</p><p>The scientific community has been warning about the trend toward more extreme weather for years, including intensifying cyclones.</p><p>Many of the casualties from natural disasters, especially landslides and flooding, reflect the vulnerability of Japanese communities, businesses and public infrastructure to torrential rains and other conditions that were not considered when homes and other facilities were built.</p><p>Despite increasingly accurate forecasts, it\'s still difficult to predict the exact track of storms and the potential damage they may bring, said Chris Field, director at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University.</p><p>\"The message for typhoon-prone areas is that all should prepare for a future of stronger storms,\" Field said.</p><p>\"It is important to understand and respond to the evidence that storms are getting stronger as a result of climate change and that investments in disaster prevention need to rise, now more than ever,\" he said.</p><p>Japan already is in crisis over its aging and inadequately maintained infrastructure. Governments lack the funding and manpower to refurbish and replace tunnels, bridges and other structures to meet improved standards for resistance to earthquakes and other disasters.</p><p>On top of that, there\'s an urgent need to improve early warning systems, build bigger seawalls and help people relocate out of vulnerable areas, Field and other experts said.</p><p>In Nagano and other areas, homes and fields that normally would be protected were inundated when swollen rivers breached dikes and levees build for the less severe flooding of earlier times.</p><p>The authorities issued clear and early warnings about the perils of the approaching typhoon, holding an emergency news conference several days before the expected landfall.</p><p>\"Please take measures to save your own life,\" public broadcaster NHK announced, again and again.</p><p>In Miyagi, trucks circulated in neighborhoods urging people to evacuate, sirens wailed and smartphones were bombarded with emails urging evacuations.</p><p>But while evacuation advisories were issued to areas affecting as many as several million people, far fewer, in the tens of thousands, heeded those warnings.</p><p>Japanese need to be more aware of disaster risks and do more to prepare on their own instead of counting on the government to take care of them, experts said.</p><p>Hiroaki Maruya, a disaster expert and professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, said Japan built many dams and embankments after World War II to reduce disasters.</p><p>But fortifying such infrastructure is costly and will take time, maybe decades.</p><p>That means it\'s better to escape even if you find out later that you didn\'t need to flee.</p><p>\"These days, we are having one big typhoon after another, and places that haven\'t flooded in decades are now at risk,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a serious problem.

German media have reported that Izmir in western Turkey was the leading candidate over sites in Bulgaria and Serbia.</p><p>Josef Braml, head of the Americas program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said that Trump appears to be trying to get ahead of calls for sanctions from Congress amid resentment among security officials over Trump\'s decision to let Turkey invade a strip of northern Syria to create a buffer zone. The military action is aimed at Kurdish fighters whom Turkey considers terrorists but who have been U.S. allies fighting Islamic State.</p><p>Braml said that much may depend on what kind of understanding Trump reached with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before announcing he would withdraw U.S. troops from the area, giving Erdogan a free hand. \"He didn\'t sell the Kurds for nothing,\" Braml said.</p><p>Tougher sanctions risk unintended consequences, such as pushing Turkey closer to China.

EU member Ireland has a land border with the U.K.\'s Northern Ireland, and both want to keep goods and people flowing freely across the currently invisible border.</p><p>A frictionless border underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.</p><p>Barnier wants a clear answer by Wednesday morning, so EU capitals can prepare for the bloc\'s two-day summit that begins Thursday. \"It is still possible this week,\" Barnier said.</p><p>The big question is how far Johnson\'s government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the European Union\'s customs union — something that would require checks on goods passing between the Britain and the EU, including on the island of Ireland.</p><p>The British government has given away little detail of the proposals it has made on that question; even government ministers have not been told specifics. In broad terms, the U.K. is proposing that Northern Ireland — but not the rest of the U.K. — continue to follow EU customs rules and tariffs after Brexit in order to remove the need for border checks.</p><p>But that sounds like a customs union in all but name — and would mean new checks or tariffs on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.</p><p>An EU official said Barnier told a teleconference of some lawmakers that the Irish Sea would largely become the customs border between the EU and the U.K. That would avoid having a visible land border on the island of Ireland between the two. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were ongoing, said some complicated issues were still being fought over.</p><p>But Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party, the pro-British Protestant party that props up Johnson\'s minority government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.</p><p>Brexit supporters are also wary that maintaining any kind of customs union with the EU will tie the U.K. to the bloc\'s regulations and limit its ability to strike new trade deals around the world — thus undermining what were supposed to be some of the key benefits of a withdrawal.</p><p>The customs proposals on the table appear similar to those put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May. Opposition from pro-Brexit lawmakers, including Johnson, led to those being rejected by Parliament three times.</p><p>In public, Johnson has not changed his tune. But the British leader was working hard behind the scenes to secure a deal that would allow him to fulfil his vow to take the U.K. out of the bloc.</p><p>Johnson\'s spokesman, James Slack, rejected suggestions Britain had only until the end of the day to firm up its proposals but said \"the prime minister is aware of the time constraints that we are under.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Johnson called French President Emmanuel Macron — one of the EU leaders most skeptical about Britain\'s intentions — to discuss where elements of a compromise could be found. Slack called the conversation \"constructive.\"</p><p>Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who had a long, intense talk with Barnier early Tuesday, said the EU believes a deal \"is difficult, but it is doable.\" He said Barnier addressed EU ministers and \"did point to progress in the last number of days where the gaps have been narrowed.\"</p><p>Still, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the British proposals to keep the Irish border protected from smuggling and fraud once it leaves the bloc were insufficient.</p><p>\"The U.K. proposal contained some steps forward but not enough to guarantee that the internal market will be protected,\" Blok said.</p><p>EU ministers insisted it was Johnson\'s turn to make the next move — and he seemed to be listening. In addition to the call with Macron, Johnson shifted Britain\'s weekly Cabinet meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday, so he could give his ministers a better idea of Brexit progress.</p><p>If talks fail or stumble ahead of the EU summit, there could always be an extraordinary meeting just ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit departure — or the Brexit deadline could be extended again.

The person also didn\'t want to be identified because the talks are ongoing.</p><p>The union has summoned its national council of factory-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting Thursday that was billed as an update on contract talks. The group could be assembling to vote on a tentative agreement. It also will decide if workers should return to their jobs before or after they vote on the deal.</p><p>\"I don\'t think Mary Barra would have returned unless they were making progress,\" said Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Worker Institute at Cornell University. \"And I don\'t think they\'d have told everybody to return to Detroit on Thursday.\"</p><p>The strike, now in its 30th day, is the longest against an automaker since a 54-day strike in 1998 in Flint, Michigan. That strike cost the company $2 billion. The union also went on a brief two-day strike against General Motors in 2007.</p><p>Both sides are under pressure to end the walkout, which has cost GM close to $2 billion in profits and forced workers to live on $250 per week, about one fifth of their base pay. Last week, with the strike dragging on, the union said it would increase strike pay to $275 per week.</p><p>Negotiators last week appeared to be deadlocked and each side issued letters or statements accusing the other of failing to bargain in good faith. A quiet period began over the weekend and negotiators worked into the night to resolve most of the remaining issues, according to both people briefed on the talks.</p><p>A union demand that all vehicles sold in the U.S. be built here apparently has been resolved, but the terms are unknown. The company did offer $9 billion worth of investments at U.S. factories, $7.7 billion from the company and another $1.3 billion from joint ventures. The $1.3 billion includes a battery cell factory in the area of Lordstown, Ohio, where GM wants to close an assembly plant.</p><p>They also apparently have agreed on wages and lump-sum payments, although the amounts are unknown. A company offer last week would give workers 4% lump sums in the first and third years of the four-year contract, with 3% pay raises in the second and fourth years. This would be in addition to annual profit-sharing checks. This year workers got checks for $10,750 each. GM also offered to lift the $12,000 cap on profit-sharing checks. The union also sought sweeter retirement benefits.</p><p>After initially trying to cut health care costs, GM agreed to leave benefits and payments untouched. Union members pay 3% premiums while most workers at large companies in the U.S. pay over 30%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>Both sides also have agreed on a path for temporary workers to get permanent jobs. GM had proposed that they become permanent after three uninterrupted years of work, but that was shortened. GM initially offered an $8,000 bonus to workers to sign the contract, but sweetened that to $9,000.</p><p>Last week the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank, estimated that GM is losing $450 million every week due to production shut downs. The total loss likely has reached $2 billion. The strike immediately silenced about 30 GM factories in the U.S. and has brought down two plants in Mexico and one in Canada. Parts companies that supply GM have had to lay off thousands of workers.</p><p>If there\'s an agreement, the strike would not end immediately. Bargainers would have to vote on a tentative agreement, followed by the union\'s International Executive Board of officers and regional directors. Then the General Motors Council of factory-level leaders, including local presidents and bargaining chairmen, also will vote.

Those meetings and a gathering Friday of finance ministers and central bankers of the world\'s 20 biggest economies are expected to be dominated by efforts to de-escalate trade wars.</p><p>The new forecast predicts global growth of 3% this year, down 0.2 percentage point from its previous forecast in July and sharply below the 3.6% growth of 2018. It would be the weakest year since global growth was a negative 0.1% in 2009 as the global economy struggled with the shockwaves from the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>For the United States this year, the IMF projects a modest 2.4% gain, down from 2.9% in 2018.</p><p>Next year, the fund foresees a rebound for the world economy to 3.4% growth but a further slowdown in the United States to 2.1%, far below the 3% growth the Trump administration projects.</p><p>IMF economists cautioned that that even its projected modest gains might not be realized.</p><p>\"With a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery, there is no room for policy mistakes, and an urgent need for policymakers to cooperatively de-escalate trade and geopolitical tensions,\" Gita Gopinath, the IMF\'s chief economist, said.</p><p>Last week, the United States and China reached a temporary cease-fire in their trade fight when President Donald Trump agreed to suspend a tariff hike on $250 billion of Chinese products that was to take effect this week. But with no formal agreement reached and many issues yet to resolved, further talks will be needed to achieve any meaningful breakthrough. The Trump administration\'s threat to raise tariffs on an additional $160 billion in Chinese imports on Dec. 15 remains in effect.</p><p>The IMF\'s forecast predicted that about half the increase in growth expected next year will result from recoveries in countries where economies slowed significantly this year, as in Mexico, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The global economy will also get a boost from recoveries or at least more shallow recessions in various stressed emerging market economies such as Turkey, Argentina and Iran. The report said that the expected rebound would represent a modest bounceback after steep economic declines this year.</p><p>This year\'s slowdown, the IMF said, was caused largely by trade disputes, which resulted in higher tariffs being imposed on many goods. Growth in trade in the first half of this year slowed to 1%, the weakest annual pace since 2012.</p><p>Kristalina Georgieva, who will preside over her first IMF meetings after succeeding Christine Lagarde this month as the fund\'s managing director, said last week that the various trade disputes could produce a loss of around $700 billion in output by the end of next year or about 0.8% of world output.</p><p>IMF economists said one worrisome development is that the slowdown this year has occurred even as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been cutting interest rates and deploying other means to bolster economies.</p><p>The IMF estimated that global growth would have been about one-half percentage point lower this year and in 2020 without the central banks\' efforts to ease borrowing rates.</p><p>\"With central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,\" Gopinath said.</p><p>In addition to trade and geopolitical risks, the IMF envisions threats arising from a potentially disruptive exit by Britain from the European Union on Oct. 31. The IMF urged policymakers to intensify their efforts to avoid economically damaging mistakes.</p><p>\"As policy priorities go, undoing the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements and reining in geopolitical tensions top the list,\" Gopinath said. \"Such actions can significantly boost confidence, rejuvenate investment, halt the slide in trade and manufacturing and raise world growth.\"</p><p>The IMF projected that growth in the 19-nation euro area will slow to 1.2% this year, after a 1.9% gain in 2018. It expects the pace to recover only slightly to 1.4% next year.</p><p>Growth in Germany, Europe\'s biggest economy, is expected to be a modest 0.5% this year before rising to 1.2% next year.</p><p>China\'s growth is projected to dip to 6.1% this year and 5.8% next year. These would be the slowest rates since 1990, when China was hit by sanctions after the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square.</p><p>For Japan, the IMF expects growth of just 0.5% next year. It foresees an expansion in Russia of 1.9%, up from 1.1% this year.</p><p>And Mexico is forecast to experience growth of 1.3% next year, far better than the lackluster 0.4% gain envisioned for this year.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 19:45:08', '2019-10-15 19:45:08'),

At some point, that card will likely incur fraud — and after reporting it, you\'ll get a replacement, but with this tactic, you won\'t have to visit multiple sites to change your autopay details.</p><p>— REQUEST A DOWNGRADE. If you have a seldom-used credit card with an annual fee, you might hesitate to close the account , which could lower the average age of your credit and affect how much total credit you\'re using, both of which are factors in credit scores. Issuers with many card options may let you switch to a no-fee card and maintain your credit line and credit history. That way, you ditch the annual fee without harming your credit.</p><p>— PLAY THE GIFT-CARD SHUFFLE. Credit card rewards for specific types of spending are typically based on where you make the purchase, not what you buy. So if your credit card gives you outsize rewards for supermarket shopping, for example, you can buy gift cards for restaurants, retailers or home-improvement stores while you\'re in the grocery aisles. Exceptions may apply — for example, the supermarket may not allow you to buy gift cards with a credit card.</p><p>— OPTIMIZE THE GRACE PERIOD. If you always pay your credit card balance in full but have a big purchase that will take weeks to pay off, consider timing it just right to maximize your grace period. Make the purchase after your statement period closes. Then, you have about a month before the next statement closes, plus the grace period, which by law is at least 21 days. All told, that could be more than seven weeks of an interest-free loan. Note: The grace period doesn\'t apply to cash advances.</p><p>— GO WITH TWO. Issuers would love you to use only their rewards card for all transactions. But one of the best tactics is to use two cards: one that gives you high rewards for certain categories of spending — such as 3% to 5% back at gas stations or restaurants — and another card that gives you good rewards on everything else, with \"good\" being 1.5% or 2% back. That way you reap substantially more rewards with the hassle of managing only two cards.</p><p>— CALL AND YOU MAY RECEIVE. The card issuer\'s phone number is printed on the back of your card, but it\'s not only for reporting potential fraud or asking billing questions. Make a mistake and get hit with a fee? Call and ask — nicely — for it to be waived. Use the same number to ask for lower interest rates or higher credit limits.</p><p>— IN A PINCH, IT\'S A TOOL. Credit cards, especially metal ones, can slice a lime, open a package or scrape frost off a windshield. They are a light-duty pry bar when fingernails won\'t cut it and a better-than-nothing screwdriver. If you damage the card, the issuer probably won\'t object to replacing it. And expired plastic cards can be cut and repurposed in a number of creative ways, from collar stays to guitar picks.</p><p>———————————————————————————</p><p>This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

On Oct. 8, a Philadelphia jury hit J&J with a stunning $8 billion punitive damages verdict in a case in which a young man grew breasts while taking Risperdal — a rare but known side effect.</p><p>During a conference call Tuesday to discuss the company\'s financial results, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts that the $8 billion award, which J&J is appealing, \"will come down based on (legal) precedent.\" He criticized plaintiffs\' attorneys for extensive negative advertising ahead of trials in which plaintiffs have argued that the talc in Johnson\'s baby powder caused ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, resulting in some huge verdicts against J&J. Wolk said the company has been overturning lost talc cases on appeal, won three talc lawsuits last week alone and knows \"how to navigate around these matters.\"</p><p>Several analysts have written recently that J&J, with about $82 billion in annual revenue, can withstand all the lawsuits and that its shares, hurt by news of big verdicts against J&J, are now a bargain.</p><p>J&J reported net income of $4.83 billion, or $1.81 per share. That was up from $3.93 billion, or $1.44 per share, in 2018\'s third quarter, when the drugmaker took a $1.13 billion charge related to research programs acquired with its purchase of Alios BioPharma.</p><p>Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $2.12 per share, easily topping analysts\' projections for $2, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.</p><p>Revenue of $20.73 billion, up 2% from $20.35 billion a year ago, also beat forecasts.</p><p>J&J\'s prescription drugs business boosted sales 5% to $10.88 billion, led by cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica and by Simponi, Stelara and Tremfya, which treat immune system disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\'s disease.</p><p>The consumer products business, which makes Johnson\'s baby shampoo, Neutrogena and Aveeno skin care products and pain relievers Tylenol and Motrin, posted a 1.6% increase in sales, to $3.47 billion.</p><p>The medical device and diagnostics business, once J&J\'s biggest segment, saw sales drop 3% to $6.38 billion. J&J has been restructuring the business for a couple of years, selling some underperforming businesses and launching new products.</p><p>The New Brunswick, New Jersey company forecast 2019 per-share earnings of $8.62 to $8.67, after adjustments for one-time items, and revenue of between $81.8 billion and $82.3 billion. In July, the company forecast adjusted per-share earnings between $8.53 and $8.63, and revenue between $80.8 billion and $81.6 billion.</p><p>During the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for additional uses for four of its medicines: blood thinner Xarelto, Type 2 diabetes pill Invokana, prostate cancer drug Erleada and Darzalex, for treating blood cancer multiple myeloma. In the European Union, Stelara received approval for treating ulcerative colitis and cancer drug Imbruvica won approval for two more uses. J&J also launched two new medical devices, a surgical stapler and a new version of its Attune knee replacement system.</p><p>In morning trading, J&J shares rose $2.81, or 2.2%, to $133.51.</p><p>—————</p><p>Follow Linda A.

The IMF urged policymakers to intensify their efforts to avoid economically damaging mistakes.</p><p>\"As policy priorities go, undoing the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements and reining in geopolitical tensions top the list,\" Gopinath said. \"Such actions can significantly boost confidence, rejuvenate investment, halt the slide in trade and manufacturing and raise world growth.\"</p><p>The IMF projected that growth in the 19-nation euro area will slow to 1.2% this year, after a 1.9% gain in 2018.

Correa prohibited protests, jailed indigenous leaders and launched swift crackdowns on any demonstration.</p><p>After swarming streets and public areas for nearly two weeks without a large-scale reaction by Moreno, who has promised to respect the right to protest, indigenous groups have emerged with new strength, Basabe said.</p><p>\"I think they\'ve taken back a political space that had practically disappeared under Correa,\" he said. \"They\'ve shown the country that they\'re here and they\'re a force to be reckoned with.\"</p><p>Leonidas Iza, one of the country\'s main indigenous leaders, told The Associated Press that he saw an indigenous president as a real possibility in the near future, even though indigenous people are less than a tenth of Ecuador\'s population.</p><p>\"It\'s not a dream, it\'s a reality that we can take on,\" said Iza, a member of the Panzaleo Quichua group from the Andean sierra. \"What we have proposed to the Ecuadorian people, even though we\'re not government officials, is that we need to construct a new economic model that\'s really decided on by the Ecuadorians.\"</p><p>As protesters left the epicenter of the protests, a park and cultural center in Quito where Iza and his followers had camped out for days, they carried out a \"minga,\" an indigenous term for a communal labor project.</p><p>City workers shoveled burned debris into dump trucks and swept the streets clean. Young protesters took down improvised barricades of paving stones, which they piled back on the construction sites they had been taken from, or on city cargo trucks. Indigenous people who spent a week protesting in the park loaded bundles of clothes onto yellow buses to head back to their homes in the sierra. Crowds waved goodbye and chanted, \"We did it!\"</p><p>Under the agreement, Moreno will withdraw the International Monetary Fund-backed package known as Decree 883 that included a sharp rise in fuel costs. Indigenous leaders, in turn, called on their followers to end protests and street blockades.</p><p>The government and indigenous leaders were working together to develop a new package of measures to cut government spending, increase revenue and reduce Ecuador\'s unsustainable budget deficits and public debt.</p><p>\"We reached our objective,\" Fabricio Molina, a farmer and rancher, said as he sat on a bus waiting to leave Quito. \"Now we hope they sign a deal, and if they don\'t we\'ll be back on the streets again.\"</p><p>The decree signed Monday vows to reduce gas prices while working to find a different subsidy arrangement that doesn\'t benefit, \"people with wealth nor gas smugglers.\"</p><p>Ecuador, a former OPEC member, was left deeply in debt by a decade of high spending by Correa\'s government and the international decline in oil prices. Moreno is raising taxes, liberalizing labor laws and cutting public spending in order to get more than $4 billion in emergency financing from the IMF.</p><p>As part of the cancelled plan, Moreno\'s elimination of subsidies drove the most popular variety of gasoline from $1.85 to $2.39 a gallon and diesel from $1.03 to $2.30. Panic and speculation sent prices soaring, with costs of some products doubling or more.</p><p>Protests over the austerity package were led by indigenous groups but drew thousands of Ecuadorians from outside that minority. Protesters blocked roads, shuttered businesses from dairies to flower farms and halved Ecuador\'s oil production, forcing a temporary halt to the country\'s most important export.</p><p>In the country\'s Amazon oil fields, protests at installations, described by some government officials as attacks, halted or slowed production.</p><p>Ecuador had been producing 430,000 barrels a day, but that had dropped to 176,029 barrels by Sunday, said an official at state oil producer Petroamazonas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. The drop in output has led to a loss of about $14 million a day, the official said.</p><p>The public ombudsman\'s office said Sunday that seven people had died in the protests, 1,340 had been hurt and 1,152 arrested.</p><p>Moreno has blamed the violence on drug traffickers, organized crime and followers of Correa, who has denied allegations that he is trying to topple Moreno\'s government.</p><p>\"These days should teach us to value peace, stability and security,\" Moreno said Monday. \"Applying the weight of the law when necessary and dialogue when possible.\"</p><p>Moreno served Correa as vice president before he become president and the two men went through a bitter split as Moreno pushed to curb public debt amassed on Correa\'s watch.</p><p>The national prosecutor\'s office said Paola Pabón, a Correa ally and governor of the province surrounding Quito, Pichincha, had been arrested on suspicion of ties to acts of vandalism committed around the capital during the protests. It was the first arrest of a Correa ally in connection with the protests.</p><p>Foreign Minister José Valencia told The Associated Press on Sunday that the Moreno administration believed Correa, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Colombia\'s far-left FARC and ELN guerrillas are working to destabilize Ecuador. He offered no proof beyond the fact that a handful of Correa loyalists and some Venezuelan nationals had been detained during the protests.</p><p>\"They have a political agenda and the violence and chaos that they sowed yesterday in the city, a coordinated chaos, lets us see this political agenda,\" Valencia said.</p><p>Correa and Maduro have denied involvement in the protests.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writer Raisa Avila contributed to this report.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 20:11:19', '2019-10-15 20:11:19'),

The 46-year-old Duflo is the youngest person ever to win the prize and only the second woman, after Elinor Ostrom in 2009.</p><p>The three winners, who have worked together, revolutionized developmental economics by pioneering field experiments that generate practical insights into how poor people respond to education, health care and other programs meant to lift them out of poverty.</p><p>\"Without spending some time understanding the intricacies of the lives of the poor and why they make the choices they make ... it is impossible to design the right approach,\" Duflo told a news conference held by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize.</p><p>Their work in rural Kenya and in India, for instance, found that providing more textbooks, school meals and teachers didn\'t do much to help students learn more.</p><p>Making the schoolwork more relevant to students, working closely with the neediest students and holding teachers accountable — by putting them on short-term contracts, for example — were more effective in countries where teachers often don\'t bother showing up for work. The winners\' recommended program of remedial tutoring is now benefiting 5 million Indian children, the academy said.</p><p>Kremer and others found that providing free health care makes a big difference: Only 18% of parents gave their children de-worming pills for parasitic infections when they had to pay for them, even though the heavily subsidized price was less than $1. But 75% gave their kids the pills when they were free. The World Health Organization now recommends that the medicine be distributed for free in areas with high rates of parasitic worm infections.</p><p>Banerjee, Duflo and others found that mobile vaccination clinics in India dramatically increased the immunization rates compared to traditional health centers that often went unstaffed. The immunization rate rose further if parents received a bag of lentils as a bonus for vaccinating their children.</p><p>Banerjee and Duflo, who are married, also found that microcredit programs, which provide small loans to encourage poor people to start businesses, did little to help the poor in the Indian city of Hyderabad; studies in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Morocco, Mexico and Mongolia, produced similar results.</p><p>Despite enormous progress, global poverty remains a huge challenge, the academy noted. More than 700 million people live in extreme poverty. Five million children die before age 5, often from diseases that can be prevented or cured easily and inexpensively. Half the world\'s children leave school without basic literacy and mathematical skills.</p><p>Still, Kremer sounded a note of hope.</p><p>\"It can often seem like the problems of global poverty are intractable, but over the course of my lifetime and career, the fraction of the world\'s people living in poverty has dropped dramatically,\" he said in a news release from Harvard. \"Over the years, we have learned a lot about what works and what doesn\'t work, and why. Governments and nonprofit organizations have become much more effective in addressing, and there is much wider recognition of how researchers and policymakers can work together in the fight against poverty.\"</p><p>Duflo and Banerjee told a news conference at MIT they weren\'t sure how to react when the Nobel committee woke them with the news of their win.</p><p>Duflo said that when the phone rang, she answered and was told it was an important call from Sweden.</p><p>She said her response was: \"Well, since you\'ve now woken me up, go ahead.\"</p><p>Banerjee said the Nobel committee asked about getting one of them on a conference call, but \"they said they wanted a woman, and I didn\'t qualify\" — so he went back to bed.</p><p>Kremer, who is in London, said he thought a message over Skype from a friend in Sweden asking to speak urgently was a scam. It was only then that it dawned on him what had happened. \"I\'m stunned,\" he said.</p><p>Colleagues applauded the three winners.</p><p>\"Well deserved!\" tweeted French economist Thomas Piketty, author of a bestselling book on inequality.</p><p>\"Fantastic decision!!\" Max Roser, a University of Oxford researcher who founded the Our World in Data project, wrote on Twitter. \"Even after two centuries of progress against global poverty I think it is clearly one of the very biggest problems in the world today.\"</p><p>Duflo said receiving the Nobel was \"incredibly humbling\" while noting that the profession is not always welcoming for women.</p><p>\"Showing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognized for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve,\" she said.</p><p>On a practical matter, Duflo told reporters that she and Banerjee, who have two young children, are like any other married couple trying to juggle kids and work.</p><p>Their children \"believe they are the center of the universe, and they don\'t accept kitchen table conversation\" about weighty matters like economics, she said.

Click here to submit your problem online. Letters are edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Dear Sahib:</p><p>First, one thing you left out of your letter: You’re a high school student! You were dealing with trying to fix the car (seven times!), plus researching your state’s Lemon Law and staying on top of your case – all while keeping up with homework, applying for college and playing on your school’s tennis team.</p><p>That’s a lot to handle. You had done so much work and were so organized, the ABC News Fixer was more than happy to give this a little push over the finish line.</p><p>You told us the first sign of trouble came one day as you drove on the highway about six months after getting the car. As you approached your exit, the shifter lost power and the “check engine” light came on. The car stalled, but luckily you were already at the ramp, so you coasted down and rolled to a stop. The car was stuck in neutral and you couldn’t turn it off because the shifter wouldn’t shift into park.</p><p>After some stressful attempts, you finally got the car into park and turned it off.</p><p>Later, when the dealership looked at it, they couldn’t find the cause. You kept driving – and it happened again. And again. When you hit a pothole…when you stopped in a fast-food drive-thru.</p><p>You took it in seven times at two different dealerships, but the problem kept happening. Luckily, you kept good records. And you looked into the California Lemon Law, which protects consumers who have persistent problems with new vehicles.</p><p>Your dad filed the case with the manufacturer – his name was on the sales contract – but you took charge of the phone calls. That became your new hobby, calling the manufacturer to try to get an update on your case.</p><p>You told The Fixer you think many consumers would have gotten tired and given up after six months of repair attempts at two different dealerships and another two months of dealing with the manufacturer.</p><p>But you kept at it.</p><p>We reviewed your documents and got in touch with Fiat Chrysler, which owns the Dodge brand, asking about the delay.</p><p>Shortly after, you got some good news – they were offering your choice of a replacement vehicle or the monetary value of your car. You opted for the money.</p><p>We asked Fiat Chrysler about the long wait, and a company spokesman said that’s just the way it is — it’s a complex process, with the title needing to clear from owner to manufacturer.</p><p>The company said that in the end, they were glad they could take care of this “in the interest of customer satisfaction.”</p><p>You were smart to stay organized and keep good records of all the problems you had with the car.</p><p>Lemon laws vary from state to state, but are generally for new cars that have persistent, substantial issues.</p><p>In your home state of California, a car is a lemon if, within 18 months or 18,000 miles, there have been two or more attempts to repair a serious problem that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, or four or more attempts to repair the same issue, or if the car has been in the shop for more than 30 days.</p><p>Here are some more tips for success in a Lemon Law case: • Act quickly. Check the deadline to file in your state. You don’t want to lose out because you waited too long to file. And be sure to contact the manufacturer, not the dealer, to file your lemon case. • Keep excellent records. Write down the purpose and date of each repair and note how long your car was in the shop each time. • If you win, you will get a replacement vehicle, or the cash value minus the mileage. • Don’t expect to get reimbursement for after-market items. If you lose your case, you can still go to court.</p><p>Note: Lemon laws don’t apply to used cars. That’s why used car buyers need to be especially careful. Here are some great tips on buying a used car.</p><p>And if you’re wondering where lemons end up, they can be repaired and resold, but their registration must disclose that they were once a “lemon buy-back” vehicle.</p><p>-The ABC News Fixer</p><p>Do you have a consumer problem?

It featured a 0.11 megapixel (MP) sensor and could only store 20 selfies, but was able to transmit a jerky video feed in real-time at about two frames per second.</p><p>Sharp J-SH04 (2000)</p><p>Sharp\'s first photo-snapping mobile placed its sensor on the rear of its handset to encourage its use as an alternative to standard cameras. Its 0.11MP snaps could then be sent to friends via email.</p><p>Sony Ericsson T68i (2002)</p><p>The handset\'s optional CommuniCam MCA-20 accessory snapped on to the bottom of the handset, helping keep down the phone\'s size when not in use. It was limited to taking VGA (0.3MP) resolution shots, but the images could be texted to others via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) if they had compatible phones.</p><p>Samsung D500 (2004)</p><p>This was one of the first handsets to offer more than one megapixel of image quality.

The trade-off was that its photos were limited to 4MP.</p><p>Nokia Lumia 1020 (2014)</p><p>This Windows Phone featured an industry-leading 41MP sensor attached to an optical image stabilisation system. It allowed users to zoom in and crop without worrying about images becoming blurred, or to combine the data to make 5MP photos with less visual noise than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>Lenovo Phab2Pro (2016)</p><p>This was the first handset to build in Google\'s doomed Project Tango depth and motion-sensing cameras. They made augmented reality features possible, such as superimposing graphical images of furniture into views of a room. Tango was short-lived, but AR has lived on by other means.</p><p>Samsung Note 8 (2017)</p><p>This was one of the first phones to feature \"live focus\" - a facility that allowed users to adjust background blur in their photos before or after taking them. It achieved this by comparing the view from each of its two rear cameras to create a depth map of the scene.</p><p>iPhone X (2017)</p><p>Apple\'s tenth anniversary handset introduced its Face ID camera system, which used tens of thousands of infrared dots to map the user\'s features. As a consequence, the display had to make space for a \"notch\", which was widely copied by rivals even if they didn\'t feature such an elaborate facial recognition system.</p><p>Pixel 2 (2017)</p><p>Google found a way to let users blur the background of their photos using a single camera in its second-generation Pixel. This made it possible to offer the effect from both its front-facing selfie camera as well as the rear sensor.</p><p>Huawei P20 Pro (2018)</p><p>The Chinese firm\'s phone was one of the first to feature three cameras on its back. But the standout feature was its ability to produce quality snaps in near-dark conditions by taking long-exposure snaps and then using machine learning software to keep the details crisp.</p><p>Oppo Reno 10x Zoom (2019)</p><p>This had two unusual camera features. Firstly, one of the rear cameras has a periscope design that directs light sideways into the device\'s body, making it possible to let users zoom into a shot more than usual without sacrificing detail. Secondly, the selfie camera pops up from the top, making more space for the display.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 20:19:09', '2019-10-15 20:19:09');

You even tweeted details about its built-in radar in advance. Others go to great lengths to try to keep details of their devices under wraps until launch day. Presumably you don\'t think that matters?</p><p>We definitely wanted to take a bit of a different approach in how we launch and reveal elements of the products. Several months ago, we started to disclose a little bit about how the product looked and some of the core technologies. We wanted to make sure people started to get excited about it and understood a little bit about it.</p><p>Of course, there are other leaks we really would prefer did not happen. And unfortunately that shows a little bit of our adolescence in that we have to make sure we\'re reducing the amount of unintentional information disclosed.</p><p>At some level, we\'re at least happy people care and desire this information. But we do want to try to reduce leaks in the future.</p><p>There\'s been controversy over facial-recognition tests carried out on the phone\'s behalf. To make sure it worked better with dark skin tones, there\'s been reports a contractor targeted homeless people offering them $5 (£4) but didn\'t property explain what was going on. Can you address that?</p><p>It was very important for us to make sure the face unlock system works for all different kinds of people, genders, races, et cetera.</p><p>And as a consequence, we wanted to make sure we were able to get a large number of data points that allowed us to perfect this model in a fair way. So, we went out and did a lot of research in this area.</p><p>It\'s come to our attention there may be some methods that were not approved, not how we would do business. So, we\'re investigating that. We would never find that acceptable. And so we\'ve suspended any data collection until this is straightened out.</p><p>Just to be clear about what you think is unacceptable. Was it the targeting of homeless people? Was it not explaining exactly what people were testing? Or what?</p><p>All of those allegations would be different than what we would find acceptable.</p><p>But do you still plan to retain the data collected in this way for 18 months?</p><p>I don\'t know that we\'ve discussed the length of time that we\'re holding data. But there have been no changes to the programme with respect to data retention.</p><p>[Note: The Verge reported being briefed about the 18-month limit in July].</p><p>But some people are going to think if the data wasn\'t collected with proper consent, surely you should delete it and start again.</p><p>This is all under investigation. So, I just want to be clear we do not know the full facts of what has happened.</p><p>But if the investigation concludes people didn\'t know what they were consenting to, are you going to delete?</p><p>The best approach here would be to discuss it once we\'ve actually looked into the facts and understood what has happened.</p><p>There\'s a lot of concern about facial recognition. You\'re selling camera-enabled devices that sit in people\'s living rooms, bedrooms, and on their front doors that use the technology. Do you accept reports about what happened with the Pixel tests help undermine confidence in Google and other big technology companies\' use of facial recognition data?</p><p>There\'s a distinction between what\'s being used to train a model for face unlock and facial recognition. There are specific use cases for these different technologies and it\'s very important to examine each one and determine if they\'re being used in a way appropriate for local laws and regulations.</p><p>It is definitely important around the world for what is societally acceptable to be clearly defined in collaboration between tech companies and governments. We want to take a very cautious and thoughtful approach to these technologies.</p><p>They are very important to debate and discuss and then together we have to clarify exactly what to do.</p><p>When Amazon recently unveiled its rival Ring smart cameras many expected them to add facial recognition but it decided not to. Do you think we need politicians to act quickly to set standards because there\'s a growing crisis of confidence?</p><p>It would be great for regulation to be clarified quickly.</p><p>The approach we\'re taking is to try to keep all of this information on devices as much as possible and always keep it private and secure and encrypted.</p><p>There\'s certainly a key responsibility to make sure the user\'s information is protected.</p><p>But everyone would benefit from clarity of standards and regulation. It is a challenging space to navigate. And it\'s very important it\'s thoughtfully navigated.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 20:20:08', '2019-10-15 20:20:08'),

The deal appears likely to benefit American farmers by increasing Chinese purchases of agricultural goods and gives some other businesses more access to the Chinese market. But the “agreement in principle” is limited in scope and exact details have yet to be put in writing — a process that has derailed negotiations with China in the past.</p><p>American officials said Friday that they would work with China on finalizing an initial agreement in the coming weeks, with hopes of signing a deal when Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping attend a summit of global leaders in Chile in mid-November.</p><p>Here’s what we know so far about what the agreement might contain.</p><h2>What’s in the Deal</h2><p>From Mr. Trump’s perspective, the centerpiece of the pact is a commitment by China to purchase between $40 billion to $50 billion of American agricultural products per year. Administration officials said that target would be reached within the second year of the pact’s enactment.</p><p>That volume would represent a huge increase over what China was purchasing before the start of the trade war. American farm exports to China peaked at around $25.5 billion in 2016, according to the American Farm Bureau, then dipped to $24.3 billion in 2017.</p><p>Since then, exports of soybeans, pork and other products have collapsed under pressure from the trade war. American farm exports to China fell to just $13.4 billion in 2018, and are on track for a similar total this year, according to the same data.</p><p>American officials have not specified which products would be purchased, or how they arrived at a $50 billion figure. But to many analysts, that level of exports seems hard to achieve. Mr. Trump himself acknowledged this on Saturday, saying in a tweet that “there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced.”</p><p>“Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!” the president added.</p><p>One factor that could sharply drive up China’s imports is its African swine fever epidemic. China has already lost about 40 percent of its hog herd to the sickness, increasing demand for foreign pork and other meats.</p><p>The $50 billion target may also include a generous estimate of how other parts of the agreement would affect sales. American officials said they had negotiated speedier food safety checks for imports into China and approvals for genetically modified products, both of which could boost trade.</p><p>Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed at a news conference Tuesday that China would speed up its purchases of American farm goods. “What the U.S. is saying is the actual situation, which is consistent with what we know,” he said.</p><p>From China’s perspective, the biggest win is a promise by Mr. Trump to cancel an Oct. 15 tariff increase, when taxes on $250 billion of Chinese goods were set to rise to 30 percent from 25 percent.</p><p>American officials could also cancel plans to impose a 15 percent tax on another roughly $150 billion of goods in December if things go well.</p><p>But that still leaves a huge swath of tariffs intact. Since the start of the trade war, the United States has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products, while China has placed tariffs on roughly $100 billion of American imports.</p><p>Trump administration officials said that China has pledged to open its markets to American financial services firms, and that banks and credit card companies would be the primary beneficiaries. But few details have been offered and many of these changes are already in the works for other countries.</p><p>Under heavy American pressure, China has announced a series of moves over the past two years to open up its banking and other financial services sectors, allowing higher levels of foreign ownership or even removing ownership caps entirely. But China is unilaterally opening up its financial services sector to businesses from all over the world, not just from the United States.</p><p>Some trade experts say the gains to American companies may be limited, pointing out that China has delayed opening its markets for so long that Chinese companies already dominate the financial sector.</p><p>The White House initially began the trade war over concerns about China’s treatment of American intellectual property, including what the administration called outright theft of technology and trade secrets.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Friday that some measures concerning intellectual property and technology transfer would be included in the “Phase 1” agreement, with additional protections included in later phases. Officials have given few details, though people briefed on the negotiations said the measures include stronger protection for copyrights and patents.</p><p>Chinese negotiators have pointed to a foreign investment law passed earlier this year as evidence that they have resolved some of the Trump administration’s concerns. That law contained assurances that China would even the playing field for foreign and domestic businesses, but it had few details. The crucial implementing regulations are not scheduled to be issued until January.</p><p>The agreement also includes new guidelines for how China manages its currency — provisions aimed at resolving American complaints that China has intentionally weakened its currency to make its exports cheaper.</p><p>People briefed on the agreement said the provisions look similar to the currency chapter in the Trump administration’s revised North American Free Trade Agreement. It also closely resembles a pledge that China gave when the Group of 20 nations’ finance ministers gathered in Shanghai in February 2016. Both texts call for countries not to devalue their currencies to achieve a trade advantage and to inform each other if they intervene by buying and selling large amounts of currency.</p><p>Some experts question whether requiring the Chinese government to disclose more data will do much to curb intervention. Beijing could respond by doing more of its intervention almost invisibly through state-owned banks, and there are some signs in Chinese data it has already begun doing so.</p><p>“The more disclosure there is of China’s formal intervention, the more China is likely to rely on shadow intervention,” said Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Obama administration Treasury official.</p><p>A big question has been whether China will stick to the promises it makes. Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, said the pact would set up “a very elaborate consultation process” with “escalation in various areas so that difficulties can be resolved.” But he added that the details were still being worked out.</p><p>American officials have emphasized that their current tariffs, and the threat of future ones, will act as an enforcement mechanism. If China violates the agreement, the Trump administration could move forward with additional tariffs on Chinese products. And if China follows through on its promises, some of Mr. Trump’s existing tariffs could be rolled back.</p><h2>What’s Missing?</h2><p>No agreement has yet been signed and some of it remains unwritten. Mr. Trump said Friday that the deal was “subject to getting everything papered,” but added he did not foresee a problem with that process.</p><p>But the United States and China have reached trade truces before — in Buenos Aires last December, and in Osaka, Japan in June — only to see them quickly crumble. That has left some critics hesitant.</p><p>“A deal that isn’t written down isn’t a real deal,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement.</p><p>Longstanding concerns about Chinese economic policies that disadvantage American companies do not appear to have been addressed.</p><p>These policies, which are often called “structural issues,” include China’s generous subsidies to certain companies, the outsized role of the government in the economy and its systematic discrimination against foreign firms. In particular, the Trump administration has often criticized Beijing’s ambitious plan to dominate cutting-edge technologies like advanced microchips, artificial intelligence and electric cars, called Made in China 2025.</p><p>China has fiercely resisted any American demands that it sees as efforts to interfere with how it runs its economy. Negotiators have discussed some measures, like requiring China to disclose more information about how it subsidizes its industries, and people familiar with the talks say such talks will continue. But American officials made no mention of these issues with regard to the initial agreement.</p><p>The agreement also excludes provisions related to the manufacturing sector. And it appears to allow China to retain, for now, its high tariffs on American-made cars.</p><p>That’s notable, because nonagricultural goods — including cars, car parts and aircraft — account for both the bulk of American exports to China, as well as the very large American trade deficit with China that Mr. Trump has criticized.</p><p>Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday that the deal would include $16 billion to $20 billion in purchases of Boeing planes, but American officials have not shared any other details.</p><p>Officials have made no mention of a point that is as crucial for American competitiveness as it is hard to resolve: China’s treatment of data.</p><p>Chinese laws block multinational companies from moving much of the data they gather on Chinese customers out of the country, meaning that many technology and retail companies must silo off their China business from the rest of their global operations. Chinese officials insist this is a matter of national security and have signaled they are unlikely to yield on this point.</p><p></p><p></p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 20:34:04', '2019-10-15 20:34:04'),

This month, H&M released plans to become climate positive by 2040, meaning it wants to do more than achieve zero carbon emissions.</p><p>But Forever 21, a similar clothing chain known for affordable, trendy apparel for teens, filed for bankruptcy in September.</p><p>Factors such as online competition and brand dilution likely contributed to the upcoming closure of 178 U.S. Forever 21 stores, but the company\'s manufacturing process could be another reason the American retailer was struggling.</p><p>Fast fashion, the practice of manufacturing trendy, non-sustainable clothing in mass quantities to be sold at cheap prices, has become a worrisome practice to people who are concerned about climate change.</p><p>Although fast fashion makes clothing cheaper for the consumer, experts say its effect on the earth comes at a much bigger price. According to the UN environment program, 8% to 10% of the world’s global greenhouse emissions are produced by the fashion industry.</p><p>Timo Rissanen, an associate professor of fashion design and sustainability at New York\'s Parsons School of Design, told ABC News that Forever 21 fell behind the curve on sustainability.</p><p>“I tried to look on what Forever 21 was doing three years ago, and they had very little happening,\" said Rissanen. “They did hold some panels in California, and that’s good, but it doesn’t actually deal with the real issues, like the emissions from chemicals.”</p><p>Rissanen, who is originally from Finland, explained that he felt Forever 21’s bankruptcy was the result of two things: a shift to online shopping and an ethical awakening.</p><p>“It doesn’t seem to me that [sustainability] was ever a priority for them,” said Rissanen.</p><p>Forever 21 responded to the criticism in a statement to ABC News.</p><p>“We strive to have a positive impact not only within our stores and corporate family, but also upon hundreds of vendor manufacturing facilities throughout the world which make our products, as well as on their employees,” the company said, adding that it has launched sustainable product lines, made recycling a priority in its stores and warehouses and has employed energy efficient lighting, solar panels and efficient transportation to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>Rissanen said his fashion students care more about the environmental impacts of their designs than ever before. Parsons also requires students to take a class on sustainable systems.</p><p>To Rissanen, the heightened awareness is partially due to youth climate activists like 16-year-old Greta Thunberg.</p><p>“It’s one of the most inspiring things I’ve seen in my career. I know a lot of men my age are annoyed by her,” he said with a laugh. “But I think she’s brilliant. She has a clear message.”</p><p>Other climate activists are following Thunberg’s lead by protesting what they call harmful fashion industry practices, including the use of unsustainable materials or fabrics, toxic dyes to treat fabrics and plastics to package goods — all of which contribute to carbon emissions.</p><p>Kate Glavan, a climate activist and 20-year-old student at New York University, gathered with a group of friends to take part in the Global Climate Strike, a protest led by Thunberg, which took place in 150 countries across the world.</p><p>She told ABC News that millennials and Generation Z care a lot about a brand’s ethics.</p><p>To Glavan, Forever 21\'s bankruptcy is not just an example of a business falling behind in revenue. “It’s a pushback,” Glavan said.</p><p>“I think [they] are standing up to something – something that aligns with their values – and that’s against fast fashion,\" she said.</p><p>While brands like Zara and H&M have made plans to change their carbon footprint, Ana Andjelic, a New York-based strategy executive, told ABC News that the problem is much deeper, starting with their business models.</p><p>“It’s difficult for them because, yes, they can start using less materials, they can have cleaner supply chains and establish more efficient distribution models, but the problem is over production,” said Andjelic, who has worked with brands like Rebecca Minkoff, Topshop and Aldo.</p><p>“They create unbelievable amounts of unbelievably cheap things that are disposable,” she said. “So I don’t know how they are going to change their business model.”</p><p>H&M told ABC News that 57% of materials in its products are recycled or sustainably sourced. H&M said it wants to increase that number to 100% by 2020 and “to become climate positive by 2040 through energy efficiency, investments in renewable energy and climate resilience.”</p><p>Zara defended its practices, telling ABC News, \"The idea is to understand what your customer wants and to fit to this demand with a very integrated and efficient supply chain -design, procurement and manufacturing, logistics and stores. Our design team takes care of every detail (fabrics, patterns) in short production runs, we make our own patterns and most of our sourcing is in proximity areas, keeping low levels of inventory. All of this is what allow us to meet customers’ needs in a responsible and sustainable manner.”</p><p>Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, explained that Forever 21’s bankruptcy was an example of how big brands have to pay attention to emerging trends like sustainability.</p><p>“Once a trend like this takes hold, the legacy brands better be paying attention,” she said.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 20:35:18', '2019-10-15 20:35:18'),

More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\'s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target.</p><p>Trump\'s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\'s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.</p><p>———</p><p>IMPEACHMENT</p><p>TRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>TRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ... I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \'Colluded\' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" — tweet Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There\'s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That\'s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.</p><p>The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.</p><p>Trump\'s reference to a \"fraudulent speech\" comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president\'s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>Schiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character.\"</p><p>Trump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.</p><p>The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.</p><p>———</p><p>SYRIA and TURKEY</p><p>TRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \"I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\'t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged...down.\" — tweets Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: That\'s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.</p><p>Both Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.</p><p>Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\'s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don\'t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.</p><p>Some of Turkey\'s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Thursday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat.</p><p>IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\' self-declared caliphate.</p><p>Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.</p><p>U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \"eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\"</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\" — tweet Tuesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\'t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.</p><p>The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.</p><p>As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ...including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\" — tweet Monday.</p><p>TRUMP: \"Most of them came from Europe.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.</p><p>Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.</p><p>Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.</p><p>———</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\'s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \"they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\" — tweet Wednesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\'t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.</p><p>It\'s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\'s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.</p><p>Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009.</p><p>Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\'s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.</p><p>———</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>TRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\'re not even close.\" — Minneapolis rally.</p><p>TRUMP: \"So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\'s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\'t think anybody is going to catch us.\" — remarks Monday on trade .</p><p>THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China\'s economy would have caught up with America\'s by now.</p><p>Even if the U.S. economy hadn\'t grown at all since 2016, China\'s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\'s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China\'s super-charged economy has never approached.</p><p>Moreover, despite Trump\'s suggestion that China can\'t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\'s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.</p><p>———</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \"New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\'s huge!\" — tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump.</p><p>THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.</p><p>McDaniel didn\'t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.</p><p>For the first two full years of Trump\'s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\'s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel\'s tweet.</p><p>Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\'s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.</p><p>Obama\'s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\'s first two years.</p><p>———</p><p>TRUMP: \"As you know, in addition to what we\'re talking about today, they\'re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren\'t doing for a long time. And they\'re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\" — remarks Monday on trade.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \"many\" car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.</p><p>The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.</p><p>Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\'s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.</p><p>Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.</p><p>Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.</p><p>———</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 21:11:27', '2019-10-15 21:11:27'),

Forbes has estimated the family’s worth at $13 billion.</p><p>Ms. Sackler’s son Richard S. Sackler was the company’s president from 1999 to 2003 and later co-chairman of the board.

The airline has removed the Max from its schedule until Jan. 6 and dropped nearly 8,300 flights between October and early January.</p><p>Investors worry that when the grounded planes return to United, Southwest and American, there will be more seats for sale and fares will drop. Cowen analyst Helane Becker said rising capacity — not all of it from the Max — will cause United\'s revenue per mile to decline next year. United didn\'t forecast that far ahead, but it said revenue per seat will be flat to up 2% in the fourth quarter.</p><p>A few years ago, United lagged its closest competitors by many financial and operational measures.

Notably, in March 2018, a machine developed by engineers at MIT managed to solve a cube in just 0.38 seconds.</p><p>What’s significant with OpenAI’s effort is the use of a multi-purpose robot, in this case a human-hand-like design, rather than a machine specifically designed to handle a Rubik’s cube and nothing else.</p><p>“The ability to solve the Rubik’s cube in the real world, on a robot hand, is actually extremely difficult,” said Matthias Plappert, team leader for robotics at OpenAI, speaking to the BBC.</p><p>“You need to very precisely control your fingers, you need to do it for a very long time without kind of messing up in between. and a lot of different things can happen in the process.”</p><p>Mr Plappert hailed the team’s method of gradually injecting complications into the process - simulated hindrances that would force the robot to adapt in order to complete the cube.</p><p>This technique - called automatic domain randomisation (ADR) - was used, the team said, to give the robot consistent, intricate dexterity that can handle changes in the environment that go beyond what a computer could predict and simulate.</p><p>In a demonstration video posted on Tuesday, OpenAI demonstrated how adding difficulty for the robot - such as nudging the cube with a giraffe stuffed toy, or covering the cube with a black sheet - did not necessarily prevent the completion of the cube (though the hand did not have a 100% record, researchers said).</p><p>While instinctive to humans, handling disruptions or complications, particularly when dealing with holding and manipulating objects, is seen as a grand challenge of robotics - a problem that will need to be solved if advanced robotics are to become commonplace in every home and business.</p><p>“We use human hands for all kinds of things,” Mr Plappert said.</p><p>“We use them to solve Rubik’s cubes, but we also use them for cooking meals. This is one of the reasons we picked the robotic hand, because it promises much more general purpose robots.\"</p><p>“The big obstacle has been manipulation. So we took the Rubik\'s Cube as an example of really how far can we push manipulation.”</p><p>But, argues Prof Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley, OpenAI’s research should not be overstated, despite being what he described as an impressive act of “showmanship”.</p><p>“The average human isn\'t particularly good at solving Rubik’s cubes,” he told the BBC.</p><p>“So when they see a robot doing it, they say, ‘well, this is better than a human’. But that\'s a little deceptive - because games are not reality.”</p><p>He said OpenAI’s ADR technique was genuine progress, but handling items more complex and unpredictable than a Rubik’s cube will require more research.</p><p>“Will we get to the point where a robot could pick up a deck of cards and shuffle them like a Las Vegas croupier? Or anyone who\'s reasonably good at doing that? That could be 10-20 years off.\"</p><p>“We’re far from being able to replace kitchen workers who chop up vegetables, or even pick up and you know, do dishwashing. All those are very complex tasks.”</p><p>The BBC has not been able to independently verify the performance of OpenAI’s robot.

Pressured by budget cuts from clients amid competition with Facebook and Google, Publicis said it was in a “painful situation.”</p><p>The ad giant behind marketing campaigns and media placement for corporations like Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and L’Oréal, Publicis slashed its sales forecast for the year. Its stock price sank. Arthur Sadoun, the company’s chief executive, sounded less than thrilled on a call with investors, saying that Publicis has “dug deep” to understand “the challenges we are facing.”</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Sadoun sent a memo to employees. Its tone was elated. After an “intense” four-month pitch, he wrote, Publicis had reached a deal with one of the largest and most coveted clients in advertising: the Walt Disney Company.</p><p>As part of its effort to persuade Disney, Publicis trotted out its new subsidiary, Epsilon Data Management, which claims on its website to have information “on virtually every U.S. consumer.”</p><p>Advertising pitches have come a long way since the 1960s, when creative teams tried to impress potential clients with snappy slogans, catchy jingles and arresting visuals while pledging to attract the housewife segment or the businessman demographic.</p><p>These days, big companies look to ad companies for their data smarts as much as their marketing expertise. The agencies with the most persuasive pitches are those that have increasingly personalized data on the patterns and preferences of a broad range of consumers.</p><p>Publicis bought Epsilon for nearly $4 billion in July with all that in mind. Since the acquisition, Epsilon has played a role in helping Publicis land accounts with the Swiss pharmaceutical colossus Novartis (NoDoz, Gas-X, Ritalin) and the snack behemoth Mondelez (Belvita, Cadbury, Chips Ahoy).</p><p>Disney already has plenty of data on its customers. But the prospect of precisely targeting potential moviegoers, theme-park visitors, hotel guests and subscribers for its coming Disney Plus streaming service appealed to the company, according to two people familiar with the pitch process.</p><p>While the Disney-Publicis deal may benefit both companies, some worry that it may put consumer privacy at risk.</p><p>“This is in essence creating a data broker division to Disney, expanding what Disney already knows, which is a lot,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “You’re telling your entire life history to Mickey Mouse.”</p><p>Disney’s kingdom expanded this year as the conglomerate closed its $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. It opened a new area at Disneyland called Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge that was the largest expansion in the park’s history, although attendance was disappointing.</p><p>On Nov. 12, the company will start its challenger to Netflix, Disney Plus. On Monday, a Twitter account for the streaming service spent nearly three hours posting a mega-thread of the titles that will be available on the streaming service, as varied as the beloved “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and the more obscure “Zenon: The Zequel.” Earlier this month, Disney banned advertising from Netflix on its entertainment television networks ABC and Freeform.</p><p>In May, Disney freshened its strategy for deciding where and when to place its marketing and whom to target with it. The company spends more than $1.5 billion a year on media, according to the advertising research firm COMvergence. Disney’s media business up for bid was worth more than $2 billion.</p><p>Disney had been working with the ad groups Omnicom, Dentsu Aegis Network and Horizon when it put the contracts up for grabs. The pitch process was managed by the media consulting firm MediaLink and involved a flurry of presentations over a two-week period in Hong Kong, Dubai, Mumbai, London and Buenos Aires, according to two people familiar with the meetings. For Publicis, it was “the most important pitch of the year,” Mr. Sadoun said in his memo.</p><p>Publicis walked away with Disney’s media business for most of the world outside North America. In North America, Publicis will take charge of media strategy for the Disney Plus streaming service as well as Disney resorts and amusement parks.</p><p>Epsilon was a major draw because of the extremely detailed  data it has compiled. The company may very well know if you are lactose intolerant or are in the market for a pickup truck with 60,000 miles on it. If you are into astrology or have taken out a home-equity loan, it may know that too.</p><p>Epsilon could, for example, beam a Disney Plus ad to parents who have bought a Lion King costume for their toddler, according to Jay Pattisall, an analyst with Forrester.</p><p>“They have the capacity to really understand who is a likely prospect for the streaming service and where that person resides online, and they can send messages in the appropriate media to that individual,” he said.</p><p>Publicis’ larger rival Omnicom won the contract for Disney channels like ABC and FX in the United States, as well as the North American account for studios like Marvel and Pixar. Omnicom also retained its regional contract for the recent Disney acquisitions 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox Entertainment Group.</p><p>On Tuesday, Omnicom reported healthier financial results than Publicis did in its recent quarterly report. John D. Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, told analysts in a conference call that he was “a little bit shocked” to see weakness in Publicis’ media business. He also said that “the Disney win is very important, but part of that win was business we already had.”</p><p>As part of its bid, Publicis proposed the creation of a new agency, Publicis Imagine, that will handle its Disney business. Omnicom also pitched a specialty agency, OMG23, a reference to the creation of Disney in 1923.</p><p>The Disney contract is a boost to Publicis. The company’s recent financial report was “alarming,” wrote Michael Nathanson, an analyst with the MoffettNathanson research firm, in a note to clients last week.</p><p>But most of the advertising industry is struggling to compete against Facebook and Google, analysts said. The platforms dominate the business of buying and selling digital ads, leaving the agencies little room to negotiate. Facebook and Google have also started working directly with many advertising clients, luring them away from traditional ad companies.</p><p>In leaning on data to improve its fortunes, Publicis is part of a larger industry trend. Dentsu bought a majority stake in the data marketing firm Merkle Group in 2016, and Interpublic Group bought the data marketing firm Acxiom in 2018.</p><p>Mr. Chester, of the Center for Digital Democracy, said that regulators had overlooked a “huge consolidation” within advertising that has allowed huge holding companies to gobble up agencies and data companies that are increasingly looking for ways to advertise using personal data.</p><p>He said that viewership data from the ad-free Disney Plus, including details involving children, could be passed on to Epsilon, which could use the information to target consumers with marketing for other Disney offerings.</p><p>“It’s Madison Avenue bringing you Silicon Valley,” he said.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 22:51:21', '2019-10-15 22:51:21'),

That began an auction process that will take place over the next week. At least one other bidder has declared intent: a consortium of New York investors led by Sam Ben-Avraham, the co-founder of the streetwear brand Kith and owner of a group of trade shows.</p><p>The two represent starkly different visions for Barneys’ future, and reflect the shift in fashion that has taken place over the last decade. The rise of contemporary and then streetwear brands reshaped consumer wardrobes and shopping patterns, as elitism was trounced by accessibility, and brick-and-mortar emporia went from being magnetic landmarks to millstones weighing down the bottom line.</p><p>The bankruptcy judge, Cecelia G. Morris, will issue her ruling on the bids on Oct. 24.</p><p>A.B.G., which has annual revenues of $10 billion, has a deal with Hudson’s Bay Company, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, to license the Barneys name if it acquires the retailer. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, A.B.G. plans to continue running the Barneys digital operation, while Saks would potentially use the Barneys name for private label collections or shop-in shops. Saks’s involvement would add a gloss of cutting-edge luxury to the Fifth Avenue retailer, allowing it to further consolidate power over the luxury department store market.</p><p>While A.B.G. has said it would try to keep Barneys stores open, especially the Madison Avenue flagship, it is prepared to close all seven of them if better rental agreements cannot be reached. It has already lined up the Great American Group to run liquidation sales. No mention was made in its offer of what would happen to current employees.</p><p>A.B.G. is essentially betting that the future of retail lies with the abstract values of brand names rather than in-person shopping experiences.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Avraham and his group, which includes his brother, Uzi Ben-Abraham (owner of the real estate company Premier Equities); Ron Roman (Bergen Logistics); Khajak Keledjian (founder and former chief executive of Intermix); Ron Burkle (Yucaipa Companies, the private equity firm that is already an investor in Barneys); and Andrew Rosen, plans to keep at least two of the remaining seven Barneys stores open, including the Madison Avenue flagship with its nine-floor footprint. It would retain at least some of the current management.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Ben-Avraham said a team was in negotiations with all of the Barneys landlords, though no agreements have been reached. He said his group had raised $70 million in equity, with plans to raise up to $150 million, and had secured commitments for at least $200 million in debt financing.</p><p>His bet is that combining his brand of downtown cool with Barneys’ uptown chic will create a new kind of community destination. “Our specialty is creating environments people want to be part of,” he said.</p><p>Originally rumored to be the first, or so-called stalking-horse, bidder, Mr. Ben-Avraham said that he had decided to wait until he had all his financing in place. He said he was committed to trying to save the brand, which he called one of his “inspirations.”</p><p>Lawyers for Barneys were still working to finalize an agreement with its first formal bidder on Tuesday, according to a 10-minute hearing at the bankruptcy court in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The lawyers said that they were working with buyers to “keep open the option” of a bid that would avoid liquidation and preserve jobs. They also said that it was possible that certain stores would keep operating under the terms of the initial bid.</p><p>“We expect to work through those remaining issues soon so we can have a signed purchase agreement as soon as possible,” a lawyer for Barneys said at the hearing. “These are not easy negotiations and there is a lot of posturing and pressure going on, but our options are relatively limited at this point.”</p><p>Neither A.B.G., which is run by its founder, Jamie Salter, nor Mr. Ben-Avraham has experience operating large department stores.</p><p>A.B.G., which bought the intellectual property of Sports Illustrated for $110 million in May, has built a global business on managing brand names, including the celebrity estates of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe. In 2016 it teamed up with the mall owners Simon Properties and General Growth and two liquidators to buy Aeropostale out of bankruptcy, a deal that could serve as a model for the proposed arrangement with Hudson’s Bay.</p><p>A.B.G. recently sold the right to publish Sports Illustrated to a digital company, which laid off a significant percentage of the publication’s staff this month.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Avraham began his career in the mid-1990s with the specialty boutique Atrium, a store that sold Nudie jeans next to Ralph Lauren, before founding Kith in 2011 with the designer Ronnie Fieg. It is both a multibrand retailer and one of the best-known streetwear lines.</p><p>Barneys was founded by Barney Pressman in 1923. Over the course of three generations of family ownership, it evolved from an off-price men’s suiting outlet into a symbol of a certain kind of New York style: unabashedly elitist and very expensive. It grew to encompass women’s wear, homewares and children’s wear, and was famous for its rows of black apparel and ability to crown rising fashion stars.</p><p>It became a victim of its own mythmaking, however, and declared bankruptcy in 1996. It changed hands several times after that, and was sold in 2012 to Richard Perry and his hedge fund, Perry Capital. Mr. Perry has by all accounts been an absentee owner in recent years, and has not been involved in the bankruptcy proceedings despite holding a 72 percent stake in the company and a seat on the retailer’s board.</p><p>Mr. Perry closed his hedge fund in September 2016 and has returned the vast majority of clients’ money; Barneys is one of the remaining investments it is working to unwind. Josh Hechinger, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, declined to comment.</p><p>Barneys reported sales of about $790 million last year, with 30 percent of that coming from e-commerce, according to its bankruptcy filing. The company, which had 2,300 employees when it filed for bankruptcy, said that the 15 stores it planned to close posted losses of $14.2 million last year.</p><p>The luxury chain’s challenges came to a head this year, culminating in “a liquidity crisis” by the summer. Its rent obligations jumped by $12 million while sales plummeted and vendors started refusing to ship inventory unless they were paid cash on delivery, according to the retailer’s bankruptcy documents.</p><p>Whether such concerns are resolved by the potential new owners’ plans is an open question.

The lawsuit points to research showing that health care costs in Northern California are higher than elsewhere in the state, including a 2018 study that found unadjusted inpatient procedure prices are 70% higher in Northern California than Southern California.</p><p>\"Much of the increased cost of health care in Northern California is attributable to Sutter\" the attorney general alleges in a 49-page complaint that details a range of anticompetitive practices it says the Sacramento-based nonprofit has pursued as it gobbled up competition.</p><p>In the 1990s, Sutter embarked on \"a deliberate strategy\" to gain market power in certain geographic areas through a campaign of mergers and acquisitions, the parties allege, noting that Sutter\'s assets rose to $15.6 billion in 2016 from $6.4 billion in 2005.</p><p>Sutter Health denies the claims, saying it faces fierce competition across the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento Valley and insurance companies are to blame for pushing up costs.</p><p>\"Sutter Health looks forward to demonstrating in court why its integrated care model promotes competition and, most importantly, benefits patients and communities,\" Sutter spokeswoman Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement. She said the largest health insurance companies support the lawsuit.</p><p>\"Insurance companies want to maximize profits by pushing insurance plans that limit their choices and result in surprise billing,\" Thoma Tan said.</p><p>At issue are several of Sutter Health\'s contracting policies that Becerra says have allowed the company to \"thoroughly immunize itself from price competition.\"</p><p>One way insurance companies keep costs down is to steer patients to cheaper health care providers through a variety of incentives. Becerra says Sutter Health bans insurance companies from using these incentives, making it harder for patients to use their lower-priced competitors.</p><p>Becerra also says Sutter has an \"all or nothing\" approach to negotiating with insurance companies, requiring them to include all the company\'s hospitals in their provider networks even if it doesn\'t make financial sense to do so.</p><p>The case was originally filed in 2014 by a group of self-funded employers and picked up steam last year when Becerra filed a similar lawsuit and the cases were combined.</p><p>Becerra\'s lawsuit seeks to halt Sutter\'s alleged practices and does not seek monetary damages. But the private litigation brought by a class of about 1,400 self-funded employers seeks damages that could exceed $1 billion.</p><p>It\'s rare for antitrust lawsuits of this size to go to trial. Atrium Health, a North Carolina-based hospital system, settled a similar anti-trust lawsuit with the federal government last year. And CHI Franciscan, a health system based in Washington state, also settled similar claims in March that had been brought by the state.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-15 23:51:19', '2019-10-15 23:51:19'),

Chicago\'s last major teachers strike in 2012 also has been cited as early inspiration by other unions.</p><p>Now, Chicago teachers are returning to that strategy, aiming to get enforceable school district commitments on smaller class sizes and hiring more support staff. Without those and other commitments, they could begin a strike Thursday that would affect nearly 400,000 students.</p><p>If Chicago does strike, teachers around the country will be closely watching parents\' response to a walkout based on the unions\' \"social justice\" agenda beyond state school funding or teachers\' pay, experts said.</p><p>\"Right now, you\'re hard pressed to find a teacher\'s union that says we only want to bargain for the economic interest of our members,\" said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois labor professor who has studied and written about the 2012 Chicago strike. \"And that\'s why it\'s so hard to get a settlement.\"</p><p>City officials, though, argue contract talks are meant for employee wages and benefits, not questions of staffing or affordable housing.</p><p>Mayor Lori Lightfoot also has said the district\'s offer of a 16% raise over five years for teachers is fair and ensures the district can continue to improve its once dire financial state. The district also has committed to hiring more nurses, social workers and support staff over the next five years but opposes teachers\' demand that be written into their contract.</p><p>After a change in union leadership in 2010, the Chicago teachers union partnered with other community groups working on poverty and crime. Teachers walked out for seven days in 2012, filling Chicago streets and using the bargaining process to force conversations on how those broader issues affected their students.</p><p>The Chicago union wasn\'t the first to use that strategy. But its leadership, including then-President Karen Lewis, acted when teachers nationwide felt unions\' political power and clout had been severely weakened, said John Rogers, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>\"Chicago was a dramatic moment, when this set of ideas coalesced and was enacted and then caught the attention of other unions,\" Rogers said.</p><p>In the years since the 2012 Chicago strike, teachers clad in red have flooded state Capitols in right-to-work states including West Virginia to protest years of cutbacks in school funding.</p><p>The response to those protests reassured teachers of the public\'s support, said Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association.</p><p>\"It is about much more than pay,\" Lee said. \"It\'s about ensuring that every student, not just a select few, has a great public education.\"</p><p>This year, unions in liberal-leaning cities including Denver, Los Angeles and Oakland, California, used contract talks to highlight class sizes and push back on charter schools.</p><p>The approach resulted in some victories: Los Angeles teachers got more money toward reducing class sizes and support staff hires; Denver teachers won changes to the district\'s pay scale; and Oakland\'s teachers got reduced class sizes.</p><p>Those changes still affect a school district\'s bottom line, and education funding in most states was never fully restored after the Great Recession, said Kency Nittler, director of teacher policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality.</p><p>\"Advocating for and winning smaller class sizes means adding teachers, adding additional staff,\" Nettler said. \"So it does feed back into this question of overall compensation from a district or administrator\'s perspective.\"</p><p>Staffing costs, including salary, health care and other benefits, remain districts\' largest expense, said Thomas Bertrand, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards.</p><p>\"When you begin to bargain issues like personnel or class levels, from a management side, you\'re now more hamstrung in managing up to 80% of your budget,\" he said. \"It\'s a delicate balance.\"</p><p>Chicago Public Schools\' finances have improved in recent years with help from higher property taxes and changes to Illinois\' formula for funding schools.</p><p>A Civic Federation review of the district\'s 2020 budget, though, warned that position remains fragile — particularly as the district deals with an underfunded teacher pension fund and declining enrollment.</p><p>Some experts wonder whether emboldened teachers can push parents too far, testing support amid walkouts that scramble thousands of families\' routines. Union leaders, though, argue that\'s unlikely since class sizes and school staffing directly affect students — and parents.</p><p>Chirag Mehta, whose daughter and son attend a magnet school on the city\'s north side, volunteers with a group called Parents 4 Teachers that has been urging parents to contact Lightfoot\'s office every week in support of the teachers union. Mehta, a 48-year-old who works for a national nonprofit, said if Chicago teachers do strike, his kids will come along to the picket lines.</p><p>\"Our school can\'t operate in a vacuum,\" he said. \"We are all in this together and we need to have a mayor, a school system, a school board that sees it the same way.\"</p><p>Tanesha Peeples, a community advocate in Chicago, said she\'s skeptical about public support for a strike this year, particularly among minority community members who worry about their kids\' safety during a walkout.</p><p>\"This can\'t be the go-to every time (the Chicago Teachers Union) feels they don\'t get what they want,\" Peeples said. \"Almost every year, there\'s a strike threat and it throws the community into a frenzy.\"</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 00:11:13', '2019-10-16 00:11:13'),

MedMen noted that a large portion of PharmaCann\'s cultivation and manufacturing assets requires \"significant capital expenditures.\"</p><p>\"There\'s been a lot less ability to go to the markets and raise capital, so investors are scrutinizing the balance sheets of public companies to see who\'s best positioned to weather the dry spell in capital markets,\" Burleson said.</p><p>Now that it has backed out of its bid for PharmaCann, MedMen said it intends to focus on building its retail brand and online business.

The law allows California residents to learn what information companies hold on them, request deletion and opt out of the sale of their personal info.</p><p>Although only California residents can make requests, the law is expected to have broader impact on how companies manage and sell people\'s information online. That\'s because companies outside the state must comply if they meet relatively low thresholds.</p><p>\"Data is today\'s gold,\" Becerra said at a press conference in San Francisco. \"Everyone is rushing to mine data.\"</p><p>The law was born out of a desire for people to have more control over their personal information online. It\'s a topic that has been top of mind in recent years as high profile leaks, smarter home artificial intelligence systems and targeted advertisements show just how much companies know about their customers.</p><p>Privacy experts and researchers expect California\'s law to pave the way for laws from other states and possibly Congress.</p><p>California\'s privacy law has been a hot-button issue for lobbyists all year, often pitting tech industry interest groups against privacy rights advocates. But neither side made major traction during the year, and the bill that was finalized last month remains largely unchanged from the original version.</p><p>The attorney general\'s proposed rules say companies must provide at least two ways — in most cases, a toll-free number and an online form — for people to request what specific information companies hold on them. To request deletion, people must first indicate they want their information to be erased, and then confirm the decision in a two-step process.</p><p>Companies will need to verify that a person requesting data is actually that person. That can be done by matching information in the request to information the company has collected over time.</p><p>Data can be deleted by completely erasing it from company systems, by removing enough information so it can no longer be associated with a named person, or by aggregating it so it\'s part of large groups of data.</p><p>Companies that serve at least 4 million Californians — which will include all large tech companies and many retailers — would also need to publish an annual report noting the number of requests they get from people to either see their own information, delete it or opt-out from sale.</p><p>The rules also state that third-party data brokers, which are often the ones selling data for advertising and other purposes, need to make sure that people are properly notified their data is being collected. Those companies, which rarely interact directly with consumers, can do that either by sending out notices or making contracts with the consumer-facing companies that people use.</p><p>The proposed regulations also make it possible for people to use browser extensions that automatically opt them out of the sale of data on each site they visit.</p><p>The law\'s original creator, real estate investor Alastair Mactaggart, recently introduced a new ballot proposal to expand on the law. It would create a new state agency to enforce the law.</p><p>The proposed rules will now open to public comment and forums before being finalized.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 02:32:30', '2019-10-16 02:32:30'),

Feral hogs are thought to be a main reason for its spread, and North Korea has been snubbing the South\'s repeated calls for joint quarantine efforts, officials say.</p><p>South Korea has culled about 154,500 pigs in the past month, all in farms near the North Korean border. North Korea hasn\'t released any detailed reports on the disease, but South Korea\'s spy agency says that pig herds in one North Korea province were \"annihilated.\" North Korea observers in Seoul say the pork prices in markets there have soared.</p><p>A look at African swine fever in North and South Korea.</p><p>——</p><p>START OF DISEASE</p><p>North Korea first reported an outbreak in May after widespread deaths of pigs in neighboring China. Chinese officials say farms there have slaughtered at least 1.17 million pigs while trying to control the disease since August 2018.</p><p>North Korea told the World Organization for Animal Health that 77 of 99 pigs at a farm in its Jagang province, which borders China, died of the disease. The remaining 22 pigs were culled. North Korea said it\'s fighting hard to stop the disease\'s spread, but has not reported any other outbreaks.</p><p>Suh Hoon, director of South Korea\'s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a private briefing last month that African swine fever has spread across North Korea. Pig herds in North Pyongan province, north of the capital Pyongyang, have been \"annihilated\" and people were complaining about the lack of meat, lawmakers said he told them.</p><p>North Korea monitoring groups say the disease occurred in North Korea well before May.</p><p>South Korea confirmed its first outbreak in the border town of Paju on Sept. 17. It has since reported 13 more cases near the border and culled 154,500 pigs, including all hogs in Paju.</p><p>——</p><p>RISKS TO SOUTH KOREA: Failure to contain the disease would be potentially devasting for South Korea\'s huge pork industry. The consequences would be much worse for the chronically food-scarce North.</p><p>South Korean officials say North Korea had about 2.6 million pigs in 14 government-run or cooperative farms before the disease\'s outbreak.</p><p>Cho Chung-hui, a former North Korean official in charge of livestock issues who fled to South Korea in 2011 says pork accounts for up to 80 percent of protein consumption for North Korea\'s 25 million people. Many North Korean households raise and sell a pig or two each year to be able to buy rice since rationing systems are in shambles.</p><p>A 100 kilogram (220 pound) hog can be sold to buy about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of rice, enough for a family for a year, Cho said.</p><p>He said North Korean animal health officials and farms do not slaughter animals even if they\'re sick.</p><p>South Korea\'s own risks are somewhat contained by the fact that most of its 6,300 pig farms, raising some 11 million hogs, are indoor facilities. The country has ample experience with fighting animal diseases after dealing with numerous foot-and-mouth outbreaks since the 2000s.</p><p>——</p><p>WILD BOARS: African swine fever spreads easily through contact with infected animals, carcasses, manure and contaminated substances such as feed, clothing and vehicles.</p><p>The Koreas\' 248-kilometer (155-mile) border is the world\'s the most heavily fortified with barbed wire fences installed in minefields, but South Korean officials and experts say wild boards could still roam in and out of North Korea by swimming across rivers.</p><p>Those rivers could also spread the disease if contaminated by carcasses or runoff from affected farms, says Sur Jung-hyang, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul\'s Konkuk University.</p><p>A powerful typhoon with torrential rains in September likely caused runoff of contaminated soil and water from North Korea in early September, Cho said. Insects and rats could also spread the virus, he said.</p><p>South Korea\'s Ministry of Environment said that samples taken from seven dead wild boars found on the southern side of the border have tested positive for African swine fever.</p><p>Whatever the source of the South Korean outbreaks, experts say controlling movements of wild boars is crucial.</p><p>———</p><p>QUARANTINE EFFORTS: To stop the disease from spreading, South Korea\'s military on Tuesday said it has deployed snipers and civilian hunters to search for and kill wild boars in border areas. They will work in shifts around the clock, using night-vision goggles to spot the animals when it\'s dark, which is when they are most active.</p><p>The military will also try flying drones equipped with thermal cameras to monitor areas for wild boars and will use helicopters to transport carcasses and other samples to labs more quickly, the Defense Ministry said.</p><p>Authorities have installed hundreds of traps and plan to install more barbed-wire fences to stop wild boars from reaching pig farms. Thousands have been assigned to enforce quarantines and beef up biosecurity practices at border farms; 2,000 checkpoints have been set up to restrict movements of people and livestock and decontaminate vehicles.</p><p>North Korea would have much less effective quarantine efforts, the experts said. When he was working in North Korea, Cho said the country did not have any disinfection trucks.

Apply to attend here. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)</p><h2>The big talking points from last night</h2><p>Candidates were pressed on a number of issues at last night’s Democratic presidential debate. But the standout moments involved topics close to the business community.</p><p>On health care:</p><p>• Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has moved to the top of some polls, faced more criticism about her universal health care proposal than she has in the past.</p><p>• Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Ms. Warren he didn’t understand “why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans.”</p><p>• And Senator Amy Klobuchar, who supports a public option, said, “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”</p><p>On tech:</p><p>• Ms. Warren, who has called for Big Tech companies to be broken up, continued to attack giants like Amazon and Facebook. “You get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time,” she said.</p><p>• Senator Kamala Harris dismissed Facebook’s argument that forcing it to break up would hurt its efforts to crack down on harmful content online.</p><p>On billionaires:</p><p>• Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, both of whom have proposed heavy taxes on the wealthy,  continued their critiques of the 1 percent. “Does everyone else on the stage think it’s more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?” Ms. Warren asked.</p><p>• But some candidates said those proposals went too far. Beto O’Rourke said that Ms. Warren’s plan was “punitive.”</p><p>• Ms. Klobuchar summed up the general feeling among the candidates. “No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.” (Referring to the hedge fund mogul Tom Steyer, who was onstage last night, she added, “Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.”)</p><p>What didn’t get much airtime: Hunter Biden’s business dealings, which underpin many of Mr. Trump’s attacks against Joe Biden. The former vice president defended his son, but none of his rivals pressed the subject further.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J. de la Merced, Lindsey Underwood and Stephen Grocer.</p><p>____________________________</p><h2>Negotiators are nearing a Brexit breakthrough</h2><p>Britain and the E.U. are inching closer to a deal, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson may be forced into concessions that could make for a tough sell at home, Mark Landler and Stephen Castle of the NYT report.</p><p>• “The prime minister is frantically trying to bridge a gap over the thorny issue of how to treat Northern Ireland in a post-Brexit Europe in time for a crucial summit meeting of the European Union later this week, two people briefed on the talks said.”</p><p>• “The down-to-the-wire talks between British and European diplomats began on Tuesday morning, with some European officials predicting that the two sides would never close the divide. As the day wore on, however, the negotiators seemed to draw closer, and news of a potential deal trickled into the financial markets, where traders drove up the British pound,” Mr. Landler and Mr. Castle write.</p><p>• “But even if he produces an 11th-hour success, analysts said, Mr. Johnson could face a familiar conundrum in London: If he gives too much ground to Brussels on the Northern Ireland border, he will not be able to win backing for the agreement from key elements of his coalition in Parliament.”</p><p>More: Markets are jumping at the prospect of a Brexit deal, but the movement may be exaggerating investors’ hopes.</p><h2>Drug makers head to court over opioid crisis</h2><p>Jury selection will begin today in Cleveland for what will be a landmark trial over the opioid crisis. The case could “help decide who should bear the cost of one of this century’s worst public health crises,” Lenny Bernstein of the WaPo writes.</p><p>It  involves lawsuits by two Ohio counties that have been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. And it will provide a test case for how thousands of other opioid cases could play out.</p><p>“Described as the most complex litigation ever, the trial will begin to sort out the welter of accusations over the crisis,” Mr. Bernstein adds. “While six drug companies are defendants in the case, jurors also may hear blame cast widely on doctors, government agencies and perhaps even drug users themselves.”</p><p>A group of state attorneys generals offered an $18 billion settlement proposal with three major drug distributors — McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen — and asked the judge in the case to give them more time, Mr. Bernstein writes, citing unnamed sources. But the judge indicated yesterday that jury selection would go on as planned.</p><h2>Who’s brave enough to invest in WeWork’s debt?</h2><p>As the co-working company prepares to decide on one of two financial bailout options — a debt package led by JPMorgan Chase and a sale to SoftBank — its bonds keep sinking. Bond investors are questioning whether they’re worth the risk.</p><p>The JPMorgan debt offering reportedly includes some bonds that would yield 15 percent, an astoundingly high coupon, Bloomberg reports. News of the potential terms sank the price of WeWork’s bonds to a new low of 79 cents on the dollar, while their yield (which moves in the opposite direction to the price) rose to 13.4 percent.</p><p>It’s a sign of how risky WeWork’s financial outlook is. The company is expected to run out of cash by the end of next month unless it raises new funding. WeWork’s board is expected to pick between the JPMorgan and SoftBank offerings this week, after seeing what investor reaction to the potential debt deal looks like.</p><p>Would-be investors are wary of taking a bet on the company. Diamond Hill Capital Management’s John McClain, for one, told Bloomberg that anyone making that wager would be “taking on substantial career risk.”</p><p>SoftBank has reportedly hired bankers at Houlihan Lokey to help consider how to restructure WeWork’s finances if its rescue plan is chosen. Options include cutting liabilities, renegotiating or ending some leases, and reviewing accounting practices and projected building valuations.</p><p>More: Jimmy Asci has quit as WeWork’s chief communications officer after six months on the job.</p><h2>Big banks are riding high, but they’re getting cautious</h2><p>Earnings at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both beat analysts’ expectations yesterday. But they, and smaller banks like Goldman Sachs, gave investors reason to worry that tougher times are around the corner.</p><p>The tale of the tape:</p><p>• JPMorgan’s profit of $9.1 billion was up 8 percent from the same period a year ago, and its earnings per share beat expectations by 23 cents.</p><p>• Citi’s profit of $4.9 billion was up 6 percent from last year, though revenue rose just 1 percent. Its earnings per share exceeded analyst estimates by 2 cents.</p><p>• Goldman’s net earnings of $1.9 billion were 26 percent lower than the same period a year ago. Its earnings per share missed analyst expectations by 2 cents.</p><p>But bank C.E.O.s are feeling more cautious now. The continuing trade war has weakened the economy, leading to potentially decreased consumer spending, fewer M.&amp;A. and I.P.O. deals, and lower interest rates, which would take a bite out of banks’ profits.</p><p>“Of course there’s a recession ahead — what we don’t know is if it’s going to happen soon,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan told journalists yesterday. And Mike Corbat, Citi’s C.E.O., said that business customers have been hitting “pause” in investing in their companies.</p><h2>The battle for Barneys’ future has begun</h2><p>The luxury department store chain, which declared bankruptcy in August, might be the subject of a bidding war, Vanessa Friedman and Sapna Maheshwari of the NYT write. The winner would decide if the retailer lives or dies.</p><p>The two bidders are:</p><p>• Authentic Brands Group, which owns over 50 brands including Nine West. It has offered to buy Barneys for $264 million.</p><p>• A consortium of investors led by Sam Ben-Avraham, a co-founder of streetwear brand Kith.</p><p>“The two represent starkly different visions for Barneys’ future, and reflect the shift in fashion that has taken place over the last decade,” Ms. Friedman and Ms. Maheshwari write. Mr. Ben-Avraham and his group would make the company’s stores havens for cool downtown labels, while A.B.G. is most interested in using the Barneys brand for e-commerce.</p><p>The future of Barneys will be decided by a bankruptcy judge, Cecelia Morris, who will issue a ruling on the bids on Oct. 24.</p><h2>Revolving door</h2><p>Dan Coats, the Trump administration’s former director of national intelligence, has rejoined the law firm King &amp; Spalding as a senior policy adviser.</p><h2>The speed read</h2><p>Deals</p><p>• Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway asked the Fed for permission to increase its stake in Bank of America above 10 percent.

Following a significant boost this year, the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for 2020 reverts to its pattern of moderate gains.</p><p>But seniors and advocates complain that the inflation yardstick used to determine the annual adjustment doesn\'t adequately reflect their costs, mainly for health care.</p><p>The COLA affects household budgets for about 1 in 5 Americans, nearly 70 million people, and that includes Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees.</p><p>Criticism of the COLA formula has been amplified by Democratic presidential candidates and congressional Democrats.

Now, Democrats are aiming to recapture older voters.</p><p>On the COLA, Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing to use a measure of inflation that reflects expenses for households headed by a person 62 or older. It usually outpaces the index currently used.</p><p>Their Social Security plans would also bolster benefits and raise taxes to keep the program afloat. In Congress, a major Social Security overhaul from Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., would also switch to a new inflation measure.</p><p>The White House had no comment on the COLA debate. Trump ran on a promise not to cut Social Security benefits. Republicans have resisted expanding Social Security, pointing out it won\'t have enough money to pay full benefits starting in 2035.</p><p>Economists debate how to best account for inflation\'s impact.</p><p>Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute think tank said the measure Social Security now uses reflects workers, not retirees. \"If the goal is to maintain seniors\' living standards, then the cost-of-living adjustment is going to fall short if it doesn\'t measure seniors\' spending,\" he said.</p><p>But former program trustee Blahous says even the current inflation measure is too generous, because it doesn\'t take into account that when prices go up, many people look for cheaper goods. \"You would be overpaying COLAs,\" he said.</p><p>Larson, whose bill has more than 200 co-sponsors, says he believes the politics of Social Security are changing because \"reality has set in.\"</p><p>\"Many Americans have not recovered their wealth and assets from the great crash of 2008,\" Larson said. \"During that time, Social Security did not miss a payment. These benefits are essential for their survival.\"</p><p>In addition to greater inflation protection, his legislation would improve the underlying benefit, particularly for low-income workers. It would extend Social Security\'s solvency by slowly raising the payroll tax rate from 12.4% to 14.8% and increasing the amount of earnings subject to the tax. Current law sets a maximum level of earnings that can be taxed — $137,700 for next year.</p><p>Polling shows Americans have doubts about the future of Social Security. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey from February found that 39% of Americans had little or no confidence the program will offer the current level of benefits in five years. Just 24% said they were very confident it would, with another 36% saying they were somewhat confident.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writers Martin Crutsinger and Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 11:31:30', '2019-10-16 11:31:30'),

Some are even switching to other meats as the dietary staple becomes unaffordable. ', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191015060029-02-african-swine-fever-super-tease.jpg', '<p>Hong Kong (CNN Business)African swine fever has ravaged China\'s pig population, and the country\'s consumers are feeling the pain. Some are even switching to other meats as the dietary staple becomes unaffordable.</p><div>Pork in China now costs nearly 70% more than it did a year ago, according to data released Tuesday by China\'s National Bureau of Statistics. The surge was so dramatic that it pushed up Chinese inflation to 3% in September, from 2.8% the previous month.</div><div>The damage that African swine fever has wrecked on China\'s pig population is hard to overstate. The country is home to half of all the pigs on the planet, and its herd has shrunk by around 130 million since the outbreak began about 13 months ago, according to a CNN Business analysis of data from the Chinese agricultural ministry. Many farmers are reluctant to restock pigs after they are slaughtered, fearing they\'ll catch the disease.</div><div>The swine fever has created a headache for a country where pork is a staple of the diet. Pork makes up around 70% of China\'s total meat consumption, according to official data for 2018. On average, a person in China eats 20 kilograms of pork each year.</div><div>Put another way, that\'s about a hamburger\'s worth of pork every day.</div><div>Pork has been important to Chinese cuisine for hundreds of years. It\'s widely used in many famous dishes, including braised Dongpo pork and twice-cooked pork. Pork is also the main filling used in dumplings, a signature Chinese dish.</div><div>The skyrocketing prices haven\'t gone unnoticed by consumers, who complain often on social media about how expensive pork has become. Some people have said the hikes are forcing them to become vegetarians. One Weibo user even suggested that the meat is more valuable than a top-of-the-line smartphone.</div><div>The price of pork has nearly doubled in some regions over the past couple of years. Pork retailed for about 32 yuan ($4.5) per kilogram in 2017, according to government data. Now it\'s selling for more than 60 yuan ($8.45) for the same amount in many places.</div><div>Drastic government measures</div><div>China has been subsidizing pork to some extent. From April to mid-September, the government gave out about 3.2 billion yuan ($452 million) in cash to low-income families so they could continue to afford eating pork.</div><div>Government officials have even toured the country to talk with people about the scarcity of pork, which could undermine social stability if left unaddressed. This week, Chinese state media reported that Premier Li Keqiang visited a street food vendor in the western city of Xi\'an. The vendor said the shop had to increase burger prices because of rising pork costs.</div><div>The country has taken other drastic steps to solve the problem, too. Last month, for example, it auctioned off 30,000 metric tons of frozen pork from its central reserves to stabilize prices.</div><div>Some pig farmers have even been raising fatter pigs as a way to produce more meat from a single animal. Jiangxi Zhengbang Technology said last month that it would breed pigs that weigh 150 kilograms before slaughtering them, up to 25% heavier than the average.</div><div>Another pig farmer, Xiangyang Zhengda, recently imported about 900 pigs — worth nearly $3 million — from Denmark to up its supply, according to China\'s commerce ministry. It\'s the first time since the crisis began that China has imported live pigs.</div><div>China has also been buying more pig meat from the rest of the world to keep its consumers happy. The country imported more than 1.3 million tons of pork in the first nine months of 2019, a 44% spike compared to a year ago, according to customs data published Monday. Imports of beef were up more than 50%, as people substitute that meat for pork in their diets.</div><div>The pig crisis also might be having an influence over how China approaches trade tensions with the United States, too. US President Donald Trump said last week that the two sides reached a preliminary trade truce that will include a commitment from China to buy US agricultural products — something China already suggested it was open to doing. Before the trade war began, China was one of the biggest markets for US agricultural exports, and pork was a huge part of that relationship.</div><div>The future of pork in China</div><div>Analysts, meanwhile, warn that the price hikes aren\'t over yet. Rabobank, a Dutch bank specializing in food and farm finance, expects the cost of pork to rise even more as the country prepares for Chinese New Year, which kicks off at the end of January.</div><div>That could force some customers to change their diets, at least for a little while.</div><div>The Weibo complaints about cutting pork out of the daily Chinese diet might have some substance behind them, too. Ting Lu, managing director and chief China economist for Nomura, said there could be a short-term change in how Chinese people eat because of the pork crisis.</div><div>\"People could turn to less expensive meat alternatives, such as chicken. Consumption for beef and mutton could also increase as winter comes,\" Lu told CNN Business.</div><div>But he said the swine fever probably won\'t change things in the long run. After all, he said, pork has been a traditional staple of the Chinese diet for generations.</div><div>\"Can you imagine the pork used in most Chinese dumplings replaced with something else?\" Lu asked. \"Once the swine fever gets under control and pork prices pull back, people will eat pork again. Even after two or three years. This is a tradition. It\'s powerful.\"</div><p></p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 12:11:26', '2019-10-16 12:11:26');

Her entire 30-year career at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has focused on vehicles that very few women drive.</p><p>The automotive sector has been making strides in recent years to hire more women in leadership positions but it\'s still an industry where men dominate the decision-making. Krear said she had few female engineering peers in the beginning and \"in most cases I was the only woman at the table.\"</p><p>Being the only woman, however, never put the brakes on her career.</p><p>\"This industry has so much opportunity,\" she said. \"The automobile is the No. 1 consumer good. I wanted to work in the auto industry from day one.\"</p><p>Krear, a board member of FCA\'s Women\'s Alliance, a group that helps employees network and find mentors, has seen the number of female employees at FCA steadily grow in the last decade. She estimates that women make up 30% to 40% of the Gladiator team, including La Shirl Turner, who, as head of advanced color and materials design at FCA, was responsible for the exterior paint, wheels, trim, headliner and carpet on the Gladiator. Ram also employed women in key roles, Krear noted.</p><p>\"We had a pretty strong representation of women,\" she said. \"The work dynamic is just amazing. You feel more like a family. You get to know each other ... we make the best decisions for the product.\"</p><p>Recruiting female engineers</p><p>Karen Horting, executive director and CEO of the Society of Women Engineers, told ABC News the Big 3 automakers in the U.S. -- General Motors, Ford and FCA -- have \"definitely made a commitment to recruit women.\"</p><p>Still, fewer than one in five engineers in automotive are female, Horting said. Women account for 27% of the domestic auto manufacturing workforce compared to about 47% of the overall labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p><p>\"Women have the same skills as men,\" Horting said. \"I hear from women engineers that they love being able to contribute to an industry that impacts so many. It\'s good business for all automakers to hire women.\"</p><p>Having more women role models in automotive would encourage young females to apply for jobs traditionally held by men, according to Cindy Schipani, a business law professor at the University of Michigan.</p><p>\"There has been a shortage of engineers and companies have needed to step up recruiting efforts across the board,\" she told ABC News by email. \"There are studies that point to the importance of diversity for improving decision-making. In addition, businesses in general, are becoming more aware of issues of unconscious bias in recruitment and promotion decisions and may be trying to address these issues. Awareness is the first step. I also think that Mary Barra\'s leadership at GM, with her background in engineering, serves as a terrific role model for women engineers, and may influence the career choices of some women.\"</p><p>A recent \"Women at the Wheel\" study conducted by Deloitte and Automotive News found the percentage of women who aspire to senior executive positions in automotive has fallen from 82% in 2015 to 41% in 2018. Moreover, the study said the industry is perceived as doing the least to attract and retain women.</p><p>Krear said her years of hard work and determination, including going back to school for her Executive MBA as a full-time mother and engineer, have rubbed off on her two adult children. Her 22-year-old daughter now plans to pursue a career in another male-centered profession: investment banking. With 30 years of experience and two master\'s degrees, Krear can prepare her daughter for what to expect as a minority in the workplace.</p><p>\"When you\'re the only woman in the room, you kind of second-guess yourself,\" she said. \"I would tell her to be herself. When you are comfortable, people around you are comfortable as well. Don\'t be afraid to offer input, and when you do -- be confident and trust yourself. If you don\'t nobody else will.\"</p><p>Women are \'big influence\'</p><p>Hiring more female Jeep employees is important, Krear said. But so is getting women to become lifelong fans of the brand.</p><p>Krear, who drives a truck every day, engineered the Gladiator so it would appeal to men and women equally.</p><p>\"We also spent a lot of time tuning the ride so it rides like an SUV,\" she said. \"The back seat folds down and it\'s all one-hand operation. You could be holding your baby, or a cup of coffee, or your puppy in your left hand and you can get to everything behind the rear seat.\"</p><p>She went on, \"The women are just in love with it. They see it and think it\'s the coolest thing on the road. They want to know what it is.\"</p><p>According to a 2014 analysis by consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, women influence 80% of the car buying decisions. Jim Morrison, head of the Jeep brand, said management constantly solicits the opinions of female customers.</p><p>\"We spend a lot of time paying attention to ladies,\" he told ABC News. \"They\'re a big influence on the purchase and ownership. We make sure we get lots of input from customers.\"</p><p>Jeep sold 16,132 Gladiators in the third-quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 23,384.</p><p>\"Sales have been good,\" said Morrison. \"We\'re still building inventory and we had our best month in August.\"</p><p>Pushing the Gladiator to its limits</p><p>Less than 15% of Jeep owners take their vehicles off-roading, according to Morrison. But Morrison and Krear wanted to prove that the Gladiator -- just like popular Wrangler SUV -- can crush, clobber and dominate any off-road obstacle.</p><p>The Jeep team and a small group of journalists, including this ABC News reporter, set out on the notorious 22-mile Rubicon Trail in September, one of America\'s most ferocious and grueling off-roading courses.</p><p>\"The sounds of scraping might freak some people out but we take our Jeep vehicles to the extreme,\" said Morrison. \"If you\'re not paying attention you\'re stuck or rolling off a cliff.\"</p><p>The Gladiator Rubicons overpowered the massive boulders and rocks that were scattered throughout the unrelenting trek.</p><p>There was screeching (from both the inexperienced journalists and skid plates below the Gladiator\'s belly), intense moments of articulation and occasional body-slams when maneuvering the truck around the rugged terrain.</p><p>Under Krear\'s direction, the 3.6-liter, V-6 engine Gladiator was built to be lightweight, stiff and durable with advanced all-wheel drive systems. It can haul a payload of 1,600 pounds with its five-link suspension system. A front-facing trail camera helps drivers to avoid sticky situations and a longer wheelbase and frame enables better weight distribution.</p><p>\"We wanted the Gladiator to be best in our segment -- an absolute reputable truck,\" Krear said.</p><p>Krear, who skillfully handled the trail in a manual Gladiator, said trucks are part of her DNA. Engineering a sports car? Not in her future.</p><p>\"I love trucks and Jeeps,\" she said. \"It\'s about being able to go anywhere and do anything.\"</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 12:31:21', '2019-10-16 12:31:21'),

It will include a Brexit bill to ratify any divorce deal with the EU, but also legislation on crime, immigration, health care, the environment and Britain\'s railways.</p><p>Johnson\'s opponents say the speech is little more than a stunt because the Conservative government lacks a majority in Parliament, making an election likely in the next few months, before most of the proposed bills can become law.

The key stumbling block has been finding a way to keep the border between the U.K.\'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland free of customs checks and other barriers once Britain leaves the EU. In recent days, both sides have moved towards compromise, but it may not be enough to bridge the gap between their positions.</p><p>EU leaders may also consider whether to grant a delay to the U.K.\'s departure date — already twice-postponed — if Britain asks for one. Many are reluctant to prolong the Brexit saga, but also want to avoid the economic pain of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>———</p><p>FRIDAY.

By some point that day, the British government and public should know what the 27 have decided.</p><p>———</p><p>SATURDAY, OCT. 19</p><p>Thousands of pro-EU demonstrators are due to gather outside Parliament in London to call for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain.</p><p>Inside, British lawmakers will meet on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands War in 1982. If the government and the EU have struck a deal, legislators will be asked to approve it. If there is no divorce agreement, Johnson could ask Parliament to back a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 — something it is highly unlikely to do.</p><p>Most lawmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement would hurt the British economy, and Parliament has several times voted to reject a no-deal Brexit. But so far lawmakers haven\'t agreed on what to do instead: some favor a Brexit deal, others want a new referendum and still others would like to cancel Brexit altogether.</p><p>The main opposition Labour Party says it might try to make support for Johnson\'s divorce deal contingent on a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain.</p><p>Parliament has already passed a law saying that if there is no Brexit deal by Saturday, the government must ask the EU to delay Britain\'s departure date. Johnson says he won\'t do that, but also promises to obey the law.</p><p>That contradiction could mean Johnson plans to challenge the legislation in court.

Besides securing the Irish border from fraud and smuggling, they must tiptoe around anything that will inflame the tensions between those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K. and those who want it to be reunited with the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>\"Brexit has been the greatest existential threat to the peace process in 25 years,\" said Eamon Phoenix, a historian at Queen\'s University Belfast. \"The island of Ireland has enjoyed really unbroken peace for 25 years after violence in which 3,500 people died ... and suddenly in the last three years, we have the risk to all that.\"</p><p>The EU underpinned the Good Friday peace deal, negotiated with the help of the U.S., because both Britain and Ireland were members of the bloc. That meant people and goods could flow freely across the frontier and allowed authorities to tear down the hated border posts that were once a flashpoint for violence.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the Irish land border has vanished, marked only by changing speed limits and signs targeted by vandals who obscure the word \"Northern\" with spray paint.</p><p>Yet after Brexit — which U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to happen on Oct. 31 — the Irish land border will become an external EU border. Negotiators are struggling to find a way to regulate trade without rebuilding checkpoints and destroying the cross-border links that have spurred economic growth on both sides.</p><p>The conflict was born almost a century ago when the Republic of Ireland, dominated by Catholics, won its independence but Northern Ireland, which had a Protestant majority, remained part of the U.K. In the 1960s, divisions over whether Northern Ireland should be part of Britain or Ireland flared into what became known as The Troubles.</p><p>The Good Friday peace deal, which includes a power-sharing unity government in Northern Ireland, let people identify as British or Irish or both regardless of where they lived, Phoenix said, allowing them to cooperate and put aside long-held political aspirations.</p><p>But Brexit, driven by English voters, has hardened those divisions. While 52% of U.K. voters backed leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, a majority in Northern Ireland — 56% — voted to remain in the bloc. Phoenix says the Brexit vote unleashed a political Pandora\'s box.</p><p>\"Suddenly those aspirations have been sort of prioritized,\" Phoenix said. \"And that is a factor that is leading to instability.\"</p><p>While the peace deal ended daily mayhem, it didn\'t bring about reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Communities remain divided, and so-called \"peace walls\" that sometimes glorify gun-wielding masked men are a backdrop of daily life.</p><p>On West Belfast\'s Shankill Road, the Union flag bunting crisscrosses the working-class neighborhood. Murals celebrate loyalist paramilitary fighters, with one proclaiming \"We seek nothing but the elementary right implanted in every man: The right if you are attacked to defend yourself.\"</p><p>People here are worried that Johnson will sacrifice their interests in hopes of securing a Brexit deal and say anything that treats Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the U.K. is unacceptable.</p><p>\"There would be an organic explosion of anger and people would take to the streets. And obviously any sensible person would be urging people ... to do so peacefully,\" said Jamie Bryson, editor of the Unionist Voice. \"But we all have to live in the real world and know that once mass amounts of people take to the streets, and once something happens and that genie gets out of the bottle, it\'s going to be difficult to put it back in.\"</p><p>Others think the genie has already escaped.</p><p>Jack Duffin leans on a walking stick as he leads guided tours through the still battle-scarred neighborhoods of Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. A former member of the Irish Republican Army, Duffin still wants to reunite the island of Ireland and thinks Brexit may help achieve that goal.</p><p>\"We have been trying to put the border to the forefront of the international community for years,\" Duffin said. \"Brexit has done that for us.\"</p><p>Some didn\'t need Brexit to be reminded of these long-standing issues.

Once the plane recedes from the news and customer confidence grows, airlines could go back to their regular policies around canceling and changing flights.</p><p>Also, while they will be willing to rebook passengers free of charge for a while, that doesn\'t mean that American, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines — the three U.S. carriers that fly the Max — can get you on the next flight. They are under no obligation to find a seat for you on another carrier, or to pay for a hotel room if they don\'t have an available seat until the next day.</p><p>\"If passengers go to the airport and decide not to fly because the flight is going to be operated by a Max, they will not be able to get compensation because it will be their own decision to cancel their trip, it will not be the decision of the airline,\" said Chrystel Erotokritou, who tracks compensation for AirHelp, a company that offers to help passengers with airline-service problems.</p><p>And if the airline offers to put the customer on a flight three days later, \"there isn\'t much the passenger can do,\" Erotokritou said. \"Either they fly with the Max or they cancel their trip, because when the (Max) comes back into service, it will mean that the aviation authorities in the U.S. and the E.U. now consider this aircraft to be perfectly safe.\"</p><p>It is safe to assume that most airline passengers have no idea what model of plane they are booked on, or whether it is a Boeing, an Airbus, or something else.

That means travelers who carefully checked the airline website to make sure they weren\'t buying a ticket on a Max could wind up on one anyway, with no advance warning.</p><p>If that happens, consumer advocates say passengers should talk to the gate agent immediately.</p><p>\"You should indicate that you\'re fearful of this plane and it would be better for everybody if they allow you to take another flight or give you a credit or a refund,\" said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, an advocacy group that sprung from protests over long ground delays during which passengers were trapped on planes. \"You don\'t want a flyer who is panicked and causing problems on the flight.\"</p><p>Aware of this situation, American and United say they will not use the Max as a last-minute substitute for other planes, although it\'s not clear how long they will stick to that policy.</p><p>Gary Leff, who writes a popular travel blog called View from the Wing, thinks airlines will have to notify passengers waiting for the plane if a substitution means their flight will use a Max.</p><p>\"I think there will be announcements — people will know they are getting on a Max, especially in the case of an aircraft substitution,\" Leff said. Airline officials, he said, \"don\'t want customers freaking out after pushback (from the gate) or after takeoff.\"</p><p>American, Southwest and United said they are still finishing details for the return of the Max and how to communicate with customers. When the time comes, they will stress that the plane will have been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Tony Roach, Southwest\'s managing director of customer experience, said the airline will highlight the software upgrades and additional pilot training that will be required before the Max is recertified. United spokesman Frank Benenati said the airline \"will be transparent — and communicate in advance — with our customers who are booked to fly on a Max.\" Feinstein, the American spokesman, said his airline\'s pilots will assure customers that the plane is safe.</p><p>Of course, there is one fail-safe strategy for travelers who are determined to avoid the Boeing plane: \"If you really want to be absolutely sure, you can fly on an airline that doesn\'t have any MAXes,\" said Hudson, the passenger advocate.</p><p>Delta Air Lines is the largest U.S. carrier that has never used the Max, and its CEO said last week Delta benefitted over the summer from the thousands of Max-related cancellations at Southwest, American and United.</p><p>It is still unclear when the Max will fly again. Boeing began working on updating the plane\'s flight software shortly after the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet off the coast of Indonesia. When the plane was grounded after the second crash — an Ethiopian Airlines Max went down near Addis Ababa after takeoff on March 10 — Boeing was optimistic that it could complete the software work in a few weeks.</p><p>That work stretched out over three months, then FAA test pilots found another problem in which computers on the plane could fail.

Your options may be few', 'Passengers who refuse to fly on a Boeing Max won\'t be entitled to compensation if they cancel', 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_2c7f245fcb974447b0e74f5138ed0672_16x9_992.jpg', '<p>At some point early next year, air travelers will need to decide if they\'re willing to take a flight on a Boeing 737 Max.</p><p>If they\'re not, they\'ll need to find out what their travel options are.</p><p>There will be no government-ordered compensation in North America or Europe for travelers who are afraid to get on the plane that has crashed twice, killing 346 people. Not after aviation regulators deem the Max safe.</p><p>However, airlines are likely to be more flexible in letting passengers change their schedules to avoid flying on a Max, at least for a while.</p><p>\"We will take care of customers who are not comfortable flying on the Max. We will rebook them,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein. The airline won\'t charge those passengers the standard $200 fee for changing a ticket, he said.</p><p>It\'s unclear how long that flexibility will last. Airlines are likely to gauge media coverage and passenger sentiment about the Max. Once the plane recedes from the news and customer confidence grows, airlines could go back to their regular policies around canceling and changing flights.</p><p>Also, while they will be willing to rebook passengers free of charge for a while, that doesn\'t mean that American, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines — the three U.S. carriers that fly the Max — can get you on the next flight. They are under no obligation to find a seat for you on another carrier, or to pay for a hotel room if they don\'t have an available seat until the next day.</p><p>\"If passengers go to the airport and decide not to fly because the flight is going to be operated by a Max, they will not be able to get compensation because it will be their own decision to cancel their trip, it will not be the decision of the airline,\" said Chrystel Erotokritou, who tracks compensation for AirHelp, a company that offers to help passengers with airline-service problems.</p><p>And if the airline offers to put the customer on a flight three days later, \"there isn\'t much the passenger can do,\" Erotokritou said. \"Either they fly with the Max or they cancel their trip, because when the (Max) comes back into service, it will mean that the aviation authorities in the U.S. and the E.U. now consider this aircraft to be perfectly safe.\"</p><p>It is safe to assume that most airline passengers have no idea what model of plane they are booked on, or whether it is a Boeing, an Airbus, or something else. Even after they board the plane.</p><p>American, Southwest and United Airlines, the three U.S. carriers that own Max jets, display the type of plane for every flight on their online schedules.</p><p>However, airlines routinely swap planes when there is a mechanical issue with one, or when an incoming plane is arriving too late. That means travelers who carefully checked the airline website to make sure they weren\'t buying a ticket on a Max could wind up on one anyway, with no advance warning.</p><p>If that happens, consumer advocates say passengers should talk to the gate agent immediately.</p><p>\"You should indicate that you\'re fearful of this plane and it would be better for everybody if they allow you to take another flight or give you a credit or a refund,\" said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, an advocacy group that sprung from protests over long ground delays during which passengers were trapped on planes. \"You don\'t want a flyer who is panicked and causing problems on the flight.\"</p><p>Aware of this situation, American and United say they will not use the Max as a last-minute substitute for other planes, although it\'s not clear how long they will stick to that policy.</p><p>Gary Leff, who writes a popular travel blog called View from the Wing, thinks airlines will have to notify passengers waiting for the plane if a substitution means their flight will use a Max.</p><p>\"I think there will be announcements — people will know they are getting on a Max, especially in the case of an aircraft substitution,\" Leff said. Airline officials, he said, \"don\'t want customers freaking out after pushback (from the gate) or after takeoff.\"</p><p>American, Southwest and United said they are still finishing details for the return of the Max and how to communicate with customers. When the time comes, they will stress that the plane will have been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Tony Roach, Southwest\'s managing director of customer experience, said the airline will highlight the software upgrades and additional pilot training that will be required before the Max is recertified. United spokesman Frank Benenati said the airline \"will be transparent — and communicate in advance — with our customers who are booked to fly on a Max.\" Feinstein, the American spokesman, said his airline\'s pilots will assure customers that the plane is safe.</p><p>Of course, there is one fail-safe strategy for travelers who are determined to avoid the Boeing plane: \"If you really want to be absolutely sure, you can fly on an airline that doesn\'t have any MAXes,\" said Hudson, the passenger advocate.</p><p>Delta Air Lines is the largest U.S. carrier that has never used the Max, and its CEO said last week Delta benefitted over the summer from the thousands of Max-related cancellations at Southwest, American and United.</p><p>It is still unclear when the Max will fly again. Boeing began working on updating the plane\'s flight software shortly after the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet off the coast of Indonesia. When the plane was grounded after the second crash — an Ethiopian Airlines Max went down near Addis Ababa after takeoff on March 10 — Boeing was optimistic that it could complete the software work in a few weeks.</p><p>That work stretched out over three months, then FAA test pilots found another problem in which computers on the plane could fail. Boeing is still working to correct that issue.</p><p>———</p><p>David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 14:13:18', '2019-10-16 14:13:18'),

And that was because our Google Waymo robo-taxi seemed incapable of leaving that motorway.</p><p>We were in Arizona to record a radio documentary for the BBC World Service about the progress towards creating autonomous vehicles that would make our roads safer and replace human drivers with robots.</p><p>Google leads this race at the moment and for the past six months has been offering a robo-taxi service, Waymo One, to a select few early adopters in and around the Phoenix suburb of Chandler.</p><p>Our first ride with Waymo took us through the quiet suburban streets, where traffic is sparse and drivers well mannered.</p><p>Here, the minivan, fitted out with a battery of sensors and high-definition cameras, performed very impressively, handling slightly tricky left turns, spotting other road users and slowing down as it passed a school.</p><p>While a Google engineer sat behind the wheel, she never intervened and soon we relaxed and forgot that we were effectively being driven by a robot.</p><p>Then, we hitched a ride with Shawn Metz, one of a few hundred locals selected as customers of Waymo One.</p><p>He told us he and his wife used the service for their weekly shop, nights out and in places with limited parking.</p><p>\"We\'re hoping to go from a two-vehicle to a one-vehicle household eventually and optimistic this technology might get us there,\" he said.</p><p>But as we headed along the motorway on the 20-minute ride to his office, things began to go wrong.</p><p>As we approached our exit, there was a solid line of traffic to our right.</p><p>An assertive human driver would probably have squeezed over and made it to the exit lane - but the robot, which cannot exceed the speed limit, was more cautious.</p><p>The car missed that exit and the next one before finally leaving the motorway.</p><p>And when we were back on the suburban streets, it appeared to freeze at a junction where it needed to turn left across traffic - after a while, the engineer behind the wheel had to take over and complete the turn.</p><p>Mr Metz told us that in his experience this was a very rare occurrence.</p><p>Nevertheless, it served as an illustration that the Waymo autonomous driving technology, widely thought to be ahead of its competitors, still needs to be refined.</p><p>It is understandable, however, that the system is programmed to be ultra-cautious.</p><p>After all, just a few miles away, another self-driving car killed a pedestrian in an accident in March 2018, which shook confidence in autonomous technology.</p><p>The car belonged to Uber, one of Waymo\'s big rivals, and it ploughed into a woman pushing a bike across a road near Arizona State University.</p><p>An investigation found that the safety driver had been watching a video on her phone at the moment of impact.</p><p>The ideal road and weather conditions coupled with welcoming local officials have made the Phoenix area one of the world\'s leading locations for testing autonomous vehicles.</p><p>At first, there was little opposition but local journalist Ryan Randazzo said the accident had shaken public confidence.</p><p>\"To have an accident that was the exact kind of thing that these cars were supposed to be able to prevent really rattled people\'s nerves,\" he said.</p><p>\"And I certainly hear a lot more feedback from people in this area who are not comfortable with these tests going on in their community.\"</p><p>Clem Wright, product manager at Waymo, admitted the Uber accident had brought home how high the stakes were in the race to build self-driving cars but stressed his company was being meticulous in its testing.</p><p>\"We have 10 million miles on public roads, gathering these different scenarios,\" he said.</p><p>\"And then we also use simulation where we say, \'Hey, here\'s a tricky situation. What if this car is coming 10 miles per hour faster? What if a bicycle is swerving into us?\'\"</p><p>Nevertheless, with huge sums being invested by both technology companies such as Google and traditional car-makers, there are some brave predictions of when the robots will be able to take to the road without a human safety driver.</p><p>Ken Washington, Ford\'s chief technology officer, told us his company\'s extensive autonomous driving programme would deliver results in a couple of years.</p><p>He said: \"Between now and 2021, we\'re going to apply that learning in a way that allows us to eventually take that safety driver out of the system on selected routes.\"</p><p>In the UK, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has also promised that \"genuine driverless cars\" will be on the roads by 2021.</p><p>Waymo has already received permission to operate without a driver in a limited area near Google\'s Mountain View headquarters, in California.</p><p>But any experiments with fully autonomous vehicles are likely to take place under strictly controlled conditions for years to come.</p><p>Myra Blanco, a researcher at the Virginia Tech Transport Institute, in the US, said we would probably see driverless cars in geo-fenced areas in two to five years but she was far more sceptical about full automation.</p><p>\"That means going from the mountains, rural roadways, all the way to the city - that is going to take a little bit longer, probably potentially a couple of decades away,\" she said.</p><p>Even then, there will be real problems in mixing the robots, the human drivers and pedestrians on the same streets.</p><p>Far from the orderly roads of Arizona, I stood with the transport writer Christian Wolmar at the hectic crossroads outside Holborn Tube station, in central London.</p><p>He pointed out that pedestrians would have no hesitation in stepping out in front of driverless cars, knowing they were programmed to stop, and the result would be gridlock.</p><p>\"Once you set the rule that driverless cars have to effectively kowtow to any pedestrian in the street, and pedestrians begin to learn that, then the whole balance of power in our streets will change,\" he said.</p><p>\"The concept just doesn\'t survive the idea of mixed use streets.\"</p><p>The robots are coming to our roads but they are still nervous new drivers with a lot to learn.</p><p>For all the warnings that millions of driving jobs could be automated out of existence, it looks as though humans will stay behind the wheel for years to come.</p><p>The radio documentary Robots on the Road will be broadcast today at 13:32 on the World Service.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 14:32:19', '2019-10-16 14:32:19'),

They will likely stay on the picket lines for at least two more days as two union committees vote on the deal. Then members have to approve it.</p><p>Terms of the tentative four-year contract were not released, but it\'s likely to include some pay raises, lump sum payments to workers, and requirements that GM build new vehicles in U.S. factories. Early on, GM offered new products in Detroit and Lordstown, Ohio, two of the four U.S. cities where it planned to close factories.</p><p>The company offered to build a new electric pickup truck to keep the Detroit-Hamtramck plant open and to build an electric vehicle battery factory in or near Lordstown, Ohio, where GM is closing an assembly plant. The battery factory would employ far fewer workers and pay less money than the assembly plant.</p><p>GM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\'s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\'s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.</p><p>Amid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health — earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter — they want a bigger share.</p><p>If approved, the contract agreement will set the pattern for negotiations at Fiat Chrysler and Ford.

Workers took almost two weeks to finish voting on their last GM agreement, in October of 2015. Then, skilled trades workers rejected it, causing further delays.</p><p>This time around — with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials — many union members don\'t trust the leadership and likely won\'t want to return to work until they\'ve gotten a chance to vote on the deal themselves.</p><p>In August, the FBI raided the suburban Detroit home of UAW President Gary Jones. He has not been charged and has not commented on the raid. Earlier this month, Jones\' successor as union regional director in Missouri was charged in a $600,000 embezzlement scheme, and another UAW official pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from union vendors. Eight other people — including five UAW officials — have been convicted over the past two years of looting a jointly run Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center for blue-collar workers.

Contract terms still needs to be approved by the union leadership, then ratified by a majority of the 49,000 U.A.W. members employed by G.M. The union had summoned officials of G.M. locals to a meeting on Thursday in Detroit.</p><p>“Out of respect for our members, we will refrain from commenting on the details until the U.A.W. G.M. leaders gather together and receive all details,” Terry Dittes, the union’s chief G.M. negotiator, said in a statement.</p><p>The walkout, the first against a Detroit automaker’s nationwide operations since 2007, has left a mounting economic toll since it began on Sept. 16. It has cost the union, its members and G.M. itself hundreds of millions of dollars in lost dues, wages and revenue, as well as idling truckers and suppliers that serve the automaker.</p><p>The tentative agreement, if it becomes final, would solve the most immediate challenge facing G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, and should provide certainty in calculating labor costs over the next four years. But she must contend with issues on other fronts, including a sales slowdown in the United States and China, and the need for big investments in electric vehicles and self-driving cars. And like other automakers, G.M. has continued to feel heat from President Trump over decisions on plant closings and foreign production.</p><p>The stakes were also high for the union. It faced discontent in its ranks over what members saw as a failure to win a fair share of the gains G.M. has made since its bankruptcy a decade ago.</p><p>If the General Motors contract is ratified, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to Ford Motor or Fiat Chrysler. Contracts with those manufacturers expired on Sept. 14, but workers have continued reporting to assembly lines while the union negotiated with G.M.</p><p>The U.A.W. is likely to try to hammer out similar terms with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, a standard practice known as pattern bargaining. The union chose G.M. as its target because the company has closed plants in the United States this year, and over the last several years has substantially increased production of vehicles at its four plants in Mexico.</p><p>Talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler may be smoother because those companies have done less than G.M. to shift production south of the border. Ford, in fact, canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico, and Fiat Chrysler has chosen to build a new Jeep factory in Detroit.</p><p>In the last five years, as American consumers flocked to high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, both G.M. and its unionized work force have prospered. In the last three years, G.M. has made $35 billion in profit in North America, and workers have been given annual profit-sharing checks averaging $11,000.</p><p>But even though G.M. was scaled down in bankruptcy, it still has excess production capacity. The company has enough plants to make about one million more vehicles than it is selling, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an independent, nonprofit group.</p><p>At the same time, G.M. is spending heavily to develop electric vehicles and self-driving technology, and its business outlook is uncertain. Auto sales have slowed in the United States, and some analysts expect a substantial decline in new-vehicle sales in 2020. Sales in China, the world’s largest auto market, have also softened.</p><p>Mark Wakefield, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. said automakers were expected to spend some $225 billion over the next five years on development of electric and self-driving vehicles. “Industry profit is still good, but it’s down from its peak of a few years ago,” he said. The combination of heavy spending and slowing sales “has created some problems for them.”</p><p>That’s one reason that G.M. has been eager to retain flexibility in the size and deployment of its work force. Among the issues in dispute was the extent of G.M.’s use of temporary workers — now 7 percent of its head count — and their path to full-time status.</p><p>Marisol Gonzalez-Bowers worked for G.M. at Lordstown, Ohio, for about 24 years, most recently in “materials,” transporting parts to the assembly line. Relocating after the shutdown, she recently took a job at the company’s Lansing Delta Township plant in Michigan, where she was trained to assemble the insides of doors — the wires and plugs. Her trainers were almost all classified as temporary workers, she said, though they had been there four years.</p><p>“They’re working their butts off,” Ms. Gonzalez-Bowers said — and “making half my wages.”</p><p>Most temporary workers earn $15 an hour, compared with roughly $31 an hour for workers hired before 2007. Most permanent workers hired after 2007, known as “in progression” workers, earn about $17 to $25 an hour.</p><p>Veteran workers are guaranteed pensions in retirement. In-progression and temporary workers have 401(k) accounts to which they contribute.</p><p>Robin Sweet, an employee at a Ford Ranger plant in Wayne, Mich., said workers were upset at both the automakers and the union for not doing more to make them whole after the concessions made during the last downturn. “We want that money back in our pay,” Ms. Sweet said in a text message.</p><p>The agreement with G.M., even if followed by accords with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, won’t end the strain on the U.A.W. president, Gary Jones, and several of his top lieutenants. A federal criminal investigation has yielded corruption charges against several union officials over the last four years, including a union vice president who was sentenced to 15 months in prison.</p><p>The scandal “is concerning to the membership,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. “It’s cast a shadow, and hangs over the union, and appears to ensnare high-ranking officials.”</p><p>The G.M. strike was the latest push by labor for a larger share of the billions of dollars in wealth created as the United States recovered from the recession of a decade ago.</p><p>On Saturday, about 3,600 U.A.W. members went on strike at Mack Truck plants in three states, demanding better wages and benefits.</p><p>Last year, teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, and North Carolina secured better working conditions after walking off the job. And grocery workers in Southern California narrowly averted a strike this month when the United Food and Commercial Workers union reached a deal with several California supermarkets. The new contract includes wage increases totaling $1.55 to $1.65 an hour over three years, as well as improved health care benefits and pension contributions.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 16:11:13', '2019-10-16 16:11:13'),

UAW officials from across the country were already set to meet in Detroit on Thursday. That had been taken as a sign that the two sides were getting close to a deal.</div><div>It is not yet certain when workers will start returning to work at GM (GM). The union statement say it will be decided at Thursday\'s meeting whether they should return to work or remain on strike until the rank-and-file ratification vote takes place.

It also led to layoffs at other GM plants in Mexico and Canada that had to shut because of the disruption in their supply chains. Many of the 10,000 US suppliers that provide auto parts and other goods and services to GM laid off staff as well. That may have idled as many as 200,000 additional workers at those companies, according to estimates.</div><div>If the strike ends this week, GM will have lost about $1.5 billion in profit, according to an estimate from the Anderson Economic Group. The group also estimates that strikers have lost about $800 million in wages. Last weekend, the union raised strike benefits 10% to $275 a week. But that is still far less than the more than $30 an hour that veteran workers receive when on the job at GM.</div><div>The union demanded some of the vehicles that GM is now building in Mexico shift back to the US factories. GM announced plans to close four US plants last November. Those plants had about 3,000 UAW members on payroll at the time of the closing announcement. GM said it has found other jobs for about 2,300 of those workers, but many had to relocate to take those other jobs.</div><div>The company has offered to to invest $8.3 billion in GM plants, according to a person familiar with the talks. That\'s an increase of more than $1 billion from its offer at the start of the strike. It said such investment would create or protect about 5,400 jobs. But the union had continued to push for vehicles to be shifted back from GM plants in Mexico, where it built about 800,000 cars and trucks last year.</div><div>The union and management also had been split on GM\'s use of temporary workers, who get lower wages and fewer benefits than permanent employees. GM said Friday that its offer included a way for those temporary workers to become permanent GM employees. GM said it offered pay raises or lump sum payments for UAW members for each of the four years of the contract, as well as improved profit sharing and a signing bonus.</div><div>GM and other automakers are dealing with declining US car sales along with the need to spend billions to develop electric and self-driving vehicles which are seen by many as the future for the industry. GM has said much of the $6 billion a year it hopes to save from plant closings would be invested in those research and development efforts.</div><div>But GM has remained very profitable, even in the face of declining sales in both the United States and China, now it\'s largest market for car sales. The union has said its members made sacrifices to save the company 10 years ago as it went through bankruptcy and bailout. It argues that given the record profits it has reported since then, the workers deserve to be compensated for those sacrifices.</div><div>Talks had taken numerous twists and turns before Wednesday\'s announcement. The two sides seemed to be getting close to an agreement two weeks ago, but on October 6 the UAW sent an update to membership saying that negotiations had taken a \"turn for the worse.\"</div><div>Three days later, GM CEO Mary Barra requested a face-to-face with union negotiators, the first time since the start of the strike she had met with them. GM management sent a letter to workers Friday defending the company\'s most recent offer and urging an end to the work stoppage — the longest in the auto industry in more than 20 years. The union responded with a statement blaming management for the strike dragging on. But Tuesday Barra and other top company officials met with the full UAW negotiating team for the first time during the strike.</div><p></p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 16:12:21', '2019-10-16 16:12:21'),

Still, Kakos says, shoppers may turn price conscious just as shelves are well-stocked for the holidays.</p><p>\"People come in with the perceived idea of, is this more expensive? Has this gone up?\" he says.</p><p>Wine retailers, distributors and importers already expect some customers to seek reds and whites from countries whose products aren\'t being taxed. And any signs that customers are balking at higher prices will force retailers to absorb their increased costs.</p><p>The tariffs are mostly on food and alcoholic beverage products such as cheese from Britain, Switzerland and Italy; olive oil from Spain; Scotch whisky and French, Spanish and German wines. They\'re also being imposed on equipment from kitchen knives to large aircraft. The administration is imposing them in retaliation for the European Union\'s subsidies of aircraft maker Airbus, the competitor to the U.S. producer Boeing.</p><p>The tariffs will be slapped on goods that arrive in the U.S. from Friday onward. One bit of good news is that much of the food and beverages to be sold during the holiday season is now in the country and headed to store shelves, so retailers generally won\'t have to suddenly come up with extra cash to pay for holiday merchandise.</p><p>\"Most people are going to be OK\" in terms of buying for the holidays, says Joe Gellert, president of World\'s Best Cheeses, a distributor with operations in New York and California.</p><p>But retailers who are his customers are worried about the long-term impact of the tariffs; they\'re hoping for trade talks between the U.S. and EU and that the Trump administration will withdraw the tariffs as it recently did with some imposed on Chinese goods.</p><p>And while retailers believe customers willing to spend top dollar on upscale products like Bordeaux and single-malt Scotch will be willing to pay extra to get the labels they want, the business owners aren\'t complacent.</p><p>\"We have not yet made any changes in respect to tariffs being implemented but we will be sure to keep an eye on the market,\" says Giles Cadman, owner of Golden West International, a San Francisco-based fine wines retailer.</p><p>Price-sensitive customers are aware they have many other choices when it comes to purchases like wine and cheese, so owners may need to change the products that they stock. Shoppers may opt for buy wine from a country like South Africa or Chile whose products are not subject to tariffs, or they may switch from a single-malt Scotch to a cheaper blend or domestically made bourbon. Instead of Stilton, they may choose an artisanal cheese from Vermont.</p><p>\"We will have to make changes to our mix because in this competitive wine market, it\'s not easy to pass rising costs to retailers and consumers,\" says Brett Vankoski, wine director for Latitude Beverage, a wine seller headquartered in Boston.</p><p>Perhaps a bigger concern is what will happen after the holidays. People in the wine business are concerned that if the tariffs are still in effect, sales of popular French rose wines will fall next summer. Those wines are scheduled to be shipped to the U.S. early in 2020.</p><p>\"French rose is one of the fastest-growing wines in the country and is a big contributor to the growth of our company and the industry as a whole,\" says Kevin Mehra, CEO of Latitude Beverage. \"The tariff has the potential to slow that growth.\"</p><p>Retailers, distributors and importers have strategies to cushion the impact of the tariffs and avoid having to charge consumers the full 25%. Each business in the distribution chain can agree to absorb a portion of the tariff.</p><p>\"One strategy is to raise the price on everything 1% and marking up these items (with tariffs) only 5%,\" Gellert says. Another tack is for a distributor or retailer to look at merchandise critically, with an eye toward winnowing out products they really don\'t need on their shelves, he says.</p><p>Retailers have less pricing leeway in states where alcoholic beverage control agencies regulate wine, liquor and beer prices and the timing of price increases.</p><p>In New Hampshire, for example, prices are set twice a year. \"This could be detrimental to companies that will now lose money on products affected by the tariffs for potentially up to six months,\" Mehra says.</p><p>But retailers of products like wine and cheese have advantages over, for example, companies that need to import steel and aluminum from the EU that\'s also being taxed by the Trump administration. It\'s not easy to find metal and metal products without tariffs, but food and alcohol purveyors have many options.</p><p>Cadman noted that even if a particular French wine becomes too pricey, there are plenty of similar ones from other countries. Sauvignon blanc, a white wine produced in California and New Zealand, is similar to France\'s Sancerre.</p><p>And, Vankoski noted, another huge European producer isn\'t being hit by import duties.</p><p>\"Italian wines are not impacted by the tariffs,\" he says.</p><p>—————</p><p>Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Now, she is taking her talent for storytelling to the audio realm as the executive producer of new podcasts to be made in conjunction with the broadcast giant iHeartMedia.</p><p>Ms. Rhimes’s production company, Shondaland, and iHeart announced the partnership, a three-year deal, on Wednesday. Under the arrangement, Ms. Rhimes will produce “a full slate” of iHeartRadio original podcasts that will be available on the iHeartPodcast Network. With the deal, Shondaland has also started a new division, Shondaland Audio.</p><p>In addition to “Grey’s Anatomy,” a network stalwart since 2005, Ms. Rhimes and Shondaland were behind ABC’s “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder.” For Netflix, Ms. Rhimes has said she plans to make at least eight new shows. The first to go into production, “Bridgerton,” a high-society soap set in Regency-era London, is based on a popular series of romance novels by Julia Quinn. With a cast that includes Julie Andrews and Rege-Jean Page, it is scheduled to start streaming next year.</p><p>Ms. Rhimes is no podcasting rookie. In 2018, Shondaland created “Katie’s Crib,” a weekly podcast focused on motherhood hosted by the “Scandal” actress Katie Lowes. That show will migrate to iHeartPodcast under the terms of the new deal.</p><p>Shondaland is “just beginning our digital journey,” Ms. Rhimes said in an email. Of her podcasting venture, she said that “if the opportunity presents itself for some crossover with our friends at Netflix, we would certainly explore it.”</p><p>Nearly a third of Americans ages 12 and up — about 90 million people — listen to podcasts at least once a month, up from 21 percent three years ago, according to a survey this year by Edison Research.</p><p>The 67 shows on NPR, the top podcast studio, were downloaded more than 151 million times last month, according to a ranking from the podcast measurement firm Podtrac. Ranked second was iHeartRadio, with 268 shows downloaded 147 million times. “The Daily,” from The New York Times, is the most popular single podcast.</p><p>Commercial time on popular podcasts can fill up months in advance, advertisers have reported. A report this summer from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that advertising revenue hit $479.1 million last year.</p><p>Conal Byrne, the president of iHeartPodcast Network, said in an email that he expected Shondaland Audio to be especially appealing to “an engaged, smart female audience” as well as “top-tier, big, established brands” interested in advertising their wares.</p><p>Shondaland podcasts will have four commercials on average, he said — one at the beginning of each episode, two in the middle, and one at the end, each 30 to 60 seconds long.</p><p>The intimacy of podcasting is attractive to some advertisers. But as the medium has evolved, the trope of a host riffing on ad copy has is no longer the only option. Ads for Shondaland Audio will use a process called dynamic insertion, which allows publishers to go with ads that target specific groups of listeners.</p><p>The data on who is listening to a given show is murky, however, and podcasting platforms do not provide “sophisticated targeting tools on par with what Facebook and other digital platforms offer advertisers,” according to an analysis conducted by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>For years, iHeartMedia, which operates about 850 terrestrial radio stations in the United States, largely sat out the podcast revolution. Then last year, it paid $55 million for Stuff Media, the producer of hit podcasts like “Stuff You Should Know.” The company has also announced plans to distribute shows like “Stuff You Should Know” translated into Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, French and German.</p><p>Now, the company offers technology that allows podcast advertisers to “reach exactly who they want, at scale,” said Mr. Byrne, the iHeartPodcast Network president.</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 17:31:17', '2019-10-16 17:31:17'),

The subscriber marks will be closely eyed by Wall Street investors, who have traded down Netflix shares about 20 percent since its last earnings report.</p><p></p><p>Analysts expect Netflix to add seven million new customers for the third quarter, including about 800,000 in the United States. If that holds true, it would be a much-needed improvement over the previous period when the company lost 126,000 paid users domestically. Investors are looking for roughly $470 million of income on $5.2 billion in sales.</p><p>The quarter will likely have benefited from Netflix’s best-known series, “Stranger Things,” which debuted its hugely anticipated third season over the Fourth of July weekend.</p><p>Netflix, which started as a DVD-by-mail service, has become a dominant force in Hollywood, and its disruptive growth has reordered the television landscape. It often outspends its rivals and has forced the industry’s biggest players to embrace streaming as they abandon, albeit slowly, the pay-television model.</p><p>Netflix is the nation’s largest digital television network with over 151 million customers around the world, including 60 million in the United States.</p><p>That audience has become critically important as well-financed competitors wait in the wings. On Nov. 1, the tech behemoth Apple plans to unveil its streaming product, Apple TV Plus; 11 days later, The Walt Disney Company intends to launch Disney Plus, which will feature Marvel’s biggest franchises, the complete “Star Wars” library and the Disney content vault.</p><p>In a cheeky marketing stunt, Disney owned Twitter for a few hours on Monday when it promoted its service on an epic Twitter thread with a seemingly endless string of titles (both famous and obscure) that will appear on Plus. Not to be outdone, Jennifer Aniston, who stars in Apple’s new signature series “The Morning Show,” drew Instagram’s attention Tuesday when she finally joined the social platform.</p><p>Both streamers will come stocked with original films and series, and both will cost about half the price of Netflix. (By early next year, Netflix will face another competitor: AT&amp;T’s HBO Max.)</p><p>That suggests that the more important consideration in its financial report is Netflix’s expectation for the current quarter, when it will come up against the biggest competitive threats it has ever faced as a streaming service.</p><p>The fourth quarter is also traditionally Netflix’s most lucrative period when it adds the most subscribers. Wall Street analysts estimate that the company will add about 9.4 million customers, with 1.4 million in the United States.

While many residents remain proud of Canada for bucking prohibition, a lot still buy cannabis on the sly, because taxes and other issues mean high-quality bud can cost nearly twice what it did before legalization.</p><p>Much of the drug\'s production and distribution over the years has been controlled by outlaw groups, including the Hells Angels, and replacing such criminality with safe, regulated sales is a key goal of legalization.</p><p>Yet legal sales in the first year are expected to total just $1 billion, an amount dwarfed by an illegal market still estimated at $5 billion to $7 billion.</p><p>\"One customer told me, \'I love you and I want to support you, but I can\'t buy all my cannabis here. It\'s too expensive,\'\" said Jeremy Jacob, co-owner of Village Bloomery, a Vancouver pot store that feels more like a museum gift shop, with its high ceilings, graceful lighting, tidy wooden shelves and locked white cabinets hiding packages of marijuana. \"The black-market producers are being well rewarded by legalization.\"</p><p>The nation has seen no sign of increases in impaired driving or underage use since it joined Uruguay as the only countries to legalize and regulate the sale of cannabis to adults — those over 19 in most Canadian provinces. Delegations from other countries, including Mexico, have visited Canada as they explore the possibility of rewriting their own marijuana laws.</p><p>But officials promised legalization would be a process, not an event, and they weren\'t wrong. Kinks abound, from what many consider wasteful packaging requirements and uneven quality to the slow pace of licensing stores and growers across most of the country.</p><p>Canada allowed provinces to shape their own laws within a federal framework, including setting the minimum age and deciding whether to distribute through state-run or private retail outlets. Some have done better than others.</p><p>The result: There now are more than 560 licensed stores across Canada, but more than half are in Alberta, the fourth-largest province.</p><p>Ontario and Quebec, which together make up two-thirds of Canada\'s population, have only about 45 shops between them. In Newfoundland, Canada\'s easternmost province, pot shop owner Tom Clarke said he\'s about to hit $1.5 million in sales but isn\'t making any money, thanks to rules that limit him to just an 8% commission.</p><p>Online sales, designed to ensure far-flung communities can access the market even if they don\'t have a licensed shop, have been underwhelming, at least partly because consumers are reluctant to pay with a credit card if that transaction might come to the attention of U.S.-based banks or border guards, said Megan McCrae, board chair of the Cannabis Council of Canada industry group.</p><p>Nowhere are the challenges of legalization more pronounced than British Columbia, which has had a flourishing cannabis culture since U.S. military draft-dodgers settled there during the Vietnam War era. They grew what became known as \"B.C. Bud,\" high quality marijuana cherished by American consumers.</p><p>In Vancouver, which has 2.2 million residents and is Canada\'s third-largest city, there was tacit approval of marijuana even before legalization. Though storefront distribution of medical marijuana never was allowed by law, about 100 dispensaries operated in the city before legalization arrived.</p><p>Around the province, authorities have visited 165 illegal dispensaries in the past year and warned them to get licensed or shut down. Despite some raids, the government has been reluctant to close them all before more licensed shops open.</p><p>Licensing has been glacial, though, thanks to a change in power in the provincial government and cities being slow to approve zoning and other requirements, partly because the province has no tax-revenue-sharing agreement with local jurisdictions. Regulatory hurdles have also made it tough for B.C.\'s many small growers to be licensed; instead, production is dominated by large corporations churning out pot by the ton from massive greenhouses.</p><p>Regulators hoped to have 250 legal shops operating in British Columbia by now; instead, they have only about 80 private stores and seven government-run shops. Through July, legal sales in B.C. were a meager $25 million. Alberta, with a smaller population, hit $145 million.</p><p>\"Everybody still uses their neighbors and their back yards,\" said Susan Chappelle of the British Columbia Independent Cannabis Association.</p><p>Nevertheless, the legal market has fans. Vancouver resident Sarah Frank, who used to grow her own marijuana plants, loves that she can walk into a clean, welcoming, legal shop and walk out with a few grams of her favorite cannabis, actor Seth Rogen\'s Houseplant Sativa brand.</p><p>\"You don\'t feel like a criminal,\" said Frank, 41. \"I have friends who can\'t travel to the States because 20 years ago they got busted with a joint.\"</p><p>Some who want to get into the legal business are still waiting. With legalization looming last year, Chris Clay shut down his gray-market pot shop on Vancouver Island for what he thought would be a few months, eager to apply for a license and reopen. A year later, he\'s still waiting.</p><p>Some of his workers went on unemployment and eventually found jobs elsewhere. He\'s barely avoided bankruptcy, and though local officials have finally started handling applications, he says it will likely be another three to six months before he\'s back in business.</p><p>\"It\'s very frustrating,\" he said. \"Tourists have been driving up and down the island all summer, saying, \'Where can we go? Where can we go?\'\"</p><p>For Mike Babins, who runs Evergreen Cannabis, the Vancouver shop where Frank buys her Seth Rogen-brand weed, it\'s just fine that legalization is developing slowly.</p><p>\"Everyone\'s watching us,\" he said. \"If anything goes wrong here, we\'re screwing it up for the whole world.\"</p><p>———</p><p>Gillies reported from Toronto.

New Zealand, Luxembourg and Mexico are among those that have looked to Canada for guidance or lessons, while Russia has chastised it for its \"barefaced\" flouting of international anti-drug treaties.</p><p>Here\'s a look at how Canada\'s experiment is playing out internationally and where the next attempts at legalization are coming:</p><p>UNITED STATES</p><p>States continue to flout federal prohibition and legalize marijuana within their borders, arguing that the nation\'s war on pot has drained law enforcement resources, had a disparate impact on minorities and failed to curb the drug\'s popularity.</p><p>Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C., have now legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, with Michigan and Illinois the most recent of 11 states to OK recreational sales.</p><p>Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives, with significant bipartisan support, passed a bill that would grant legal marijuana businesses access to banking while sheltering financial institutions from prosecution for handling marijuana-linked money. That would clear up a serious headache for the industry. Many pot businesses have had to conduct sales and pay vendors or taxes in cash, making them robbery targets and also making it harder to detect theft, tax evasion and money laundering.</p><p>Advocates say the vote was a sign the U.S., long the world\'s leading proponent of the drug war, is ready for comprehensive cannabis reform.</p><p>———</p><p>LUXEMBOURG</p><p>The small nation of about 615,000 people has decriminalized possession of small amounts of the drug, and since January it has allowed medical use. Now it is aiming to become the first country in Europe to legalize and regulate recreational sales to adults, a development that could lead to broader cannabis regulation in the European Union.</p><p>The government has announced that it intends to legalize sales, with Health Minister Etienne Schneider recently telling the Euronews television network that the country\'s cannabis legislation will be \"inspired by the Canadian model.\" Officials estimate that it will take about two years before legal sales begin.</p><p>While Schneider said Luxembourg\'s legalization won\'t force the hand of other EU nations, he said he intended to speak with counterparts in Germany, France and Belgium, the countries that border Luxembourg, and encourage them to explore the possibility of regulating the drug. In the meantime, Schneider said, Luxembourg will respect their prohibitions by limiting sales to Luxembourg residents.</p><p>———</p><p>MEXICO</p><p>Mexico\'s Supreme Court ruled last year that the government\'s ban on the personal use of marijuana was unconstitutional, the culmination of a series of rulings against prohibition since 2015. That\'s helped put Mexico on a path toward full legalization. Before he was even sworn in, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sent emissaries to Canada to discuss its approach to cannabis.</p><p>Things are moving quickly now, with the ruling party\'s Senate leader saying the chamber intends to vote on a new legalization measure by the end of this month, following dozens of forums in which politicians, advocates and voters have worked out what a regulated system might look like.</p><p>\"The importance of Canada having regulated is that it broke the taboo on an international level in a way that Uruguay did not,\" said Zara Snapp, a drug policy reform advocate in Mexico City. \"For us, what it taught us is there is a path, and that path is possible without there being any apocalyptic sanctions from international bodies.\"</p><p>That said, after severe drug-war violence, Mexico\'s legalization is not likely to mirror Canada\'s, where a few massive corporations have dominated production and more artisanal growers have largely been shut out. For example, lawmakers are considering giving greater licensing privileges to indigenous groups, she said.</p><p>\"We need it to have a way bigger impact than just tax revenue or stock exchange values,\" Snapp said. \"The things that indicate success in other jurisdictions are not going to be the same indicators of success for us.\"</p><p>———</p><p>NEW ZEALAND</p><p>New Zealand will hold a referendum next year on whether to legalize and regulate the adult use of marijuana — the first country to put legalization to a nationwide vote. Officials are still hammering out the exact language, but in a speech last month Justice Minister Andrew Little said the measure would include a minimum purchase and use age of 20; a ban on using the drug in public; limits on home growing, marketing and advertising; a public education program; and licensing requirements for the entire supply chain.</p><p>\"The approach we are taking is that in the event of a \'Yes\' vote in the referendum, it will be necessary to have a regime that affords maximum control, so that the obvious risks can be minimized,\" Little told a drug policy symposium last month.</p><p>Whether the vote will be binding is a matter of dispute. The three parties that make up New Zealand\'s governing coalition have vowed to honor it, but legislation would be required to effect legalization, and the center-right party National has not made clear whether it will support the bill.</p><p>Advocates have expressed concern about social justice in New Zealand\'s legalization efforts as well, suggesting that its model could strike a balance between Uruguay, where access to cannabis is tightly controlled at a small number of pharmacies, and the more commercial approach taken by some Canadian provinces and U.S. states.</p><p>———</p><p>RUSSIA</p><p>Canada\'s legalization hasn\'t been uniformly well received. Russia\'s representative to the international Commission on Narcotic Drugs lamented the \"barefaced\" and \"blatant violation by Canada of its international obligations\" under anti-drug treaties.</p><p>\"There exists real danger that some other countries may follow the example set by Canada, which would lead to the erosion and even dismantling of the whole international legal foundation of our fight against narcotic drugs,\" Mikhail Ulyanov said.</p><p>As recently as this month, Russia\'s mission to the UN tweeted: \"#Legalization of narcotic drugs, including cannabis, for recreational purposes constitutes a grave violation of the international law.\"</p><p>But Russia may have ulterior motives in criticizing Canada, given what many world leaders consider to be its own flouting of international law in annexing Crimea, among other issues.</p><p>\"Russia has its reasons for trying to call out a country like Canada on its commitment to international rule of law,\" said John Walsh, who monitors global drug policy with the advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America. \"They delight in being able to say Canada is athwart its obligations. But I don\'t think Russia\'s bluster is going to keep other countries from moving forward.\"</p><p>———</p><p>Gene Johnson is a member of the AP\'s marijuana beat team and can be followed at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle .

But the damage from Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade policy will continue to weigh on the global economy.</p><p>The “agreement in principle” with China — which has yet to be finalized — would not roll back the hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs that China and America have placed on each others’ products. Mr. Trump is also escalating his trade fight on other fronts, including slapping higher tariffs on Turkey and preparing to tax $7.5 billion worth of wine, cheese, aircraft and other European goods on Friday. His administration will decide next month whether to impose tariffs on cars imported from Europe and other countries.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump dangled the possibility of additional tariffs on the European Union if the bloc is unwilling to reduce the trade imbalance between the United States and the E.U.</p><p>“I could solve the problem instantly, but it would be too harsh. It would involve tariffs on European products coming into this country and for right now we’re going to try and do it without that. But that would solve the problem instantly, because the United States is not being treated fairly,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference with the Italian president.</p><p>Mr. Trump has defended his unpredictable approach, saying it has created leverage and elicited trade concessions from China, Mexico, Japan and others. The administration has now signed limited deals with South Korea and Japan, and is awaiting congressional approval of a revised North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>But those gains have come at a cost. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have raised prices for businesses, uprooted global supply chains and created crippling uncertainty for companies, delaying investment and hiring. The pain has spread beyond the United States and China, exacerbating a global economic slowdown, particularly in Europe. Economists warn the damage is likely to outlast any interim trade deal with China.</p><p>On Wednesday, retail sales in the United States fell for the first time in seven months as consumers slowed spending, particularly on autos. American manufacturing is already in a recession and factories around the world are slowing production.</p><p>In new forecasts released Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund lowered its expectations for global growth in 2019 to 3.0 percent, the lowest rate since the financial crisis. The fund attributed much of the damage to rising trade barriers and trade uncertainty, which it blamed for reducing investment and demand for machinery and equipment.</p><p>“The major risk to the global economy is a further escalation in trade and geopolitical tensions,” said Gita Gopinath, the director of the research department at the International Monetary Fund. “This can derail an already fragile recovery in emerging and developing economies and in the euro area.”</p><p>David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, noted in a speech earlier this month that global economic growth is expected to grow by 2.6 percent this year, the slowest rate in three years. He cited trade uncertainty, along with Brexit and Europe’s recession as the primary reasons for the slowdown.</p><p>The World Trade Organization also said that global trade in merchandise is expected to expand by only 1.2 percent during 2019, in what would be the weakest year since 2009, when the global economy was mired in recession.</p><p>Not all of these negative economic effects are a result of the trade war. A credit slowdown in China and weakness in Europe are also weighing on trade and growth. But policymakers say Mr. Trump’s trade policies could help tip the global economy into recession.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has begun cutting interest rates to try and insulate the American economy against the effects of Mr. Trump’s trade war. But officials have warned that their power is limited and that economic damage is likely to persist, particularly if uncertainty continues and tariffs remain in effect.</p><p>“The markets have had this idea that trade would be an issue but resolution was just around the corner. That is what I am pushing back on,” James B. Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in London this week. “We have opened Pandora’s box. Trade is very hard to resolve. They are very long and very involved — over a long period of time.”</p><p>Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said last week that the central bank was monitoring weaker global growth and uncertainties arising from trade tensions as well as Britain’s negotiations to leave the European Union. Mr. Powell warned in September that economic damage could outlast any cooling of tensions, particularly if tariffs remain in place.</p><p>“I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time — a more protectionist world — that’s going to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies,” Mr. Powell said at a news conference following the Fed’s last meeting.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his advisers have attributed any slowdown in growth to troubles overseas and not the trade war. And the administration continues to insist that China is paying the cost of the tariffs, not American businesses or consumers. Mr. Trump has also argued that Beijing has offset some of the tariff pain by weakening its currency to make its goods cheaper overseas.</p><p>But a new paper by researchers at Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston suggests that businesses and consumers in the United States are feeling an impact from the trade fight and that the pain could escalate.</p><p>Examining the prices paid at the border, the researchers found that almost all of the tariffs’ cost is being passed on from businesses in China to American importers. When it comes to the prices of these goods at American stores, however, they find the evidence is more mixed, suggesting retailers are absorbing at least some of the cost of the tariffs, at least temporarily, by reducing their profit margins, rather than passing the entire cost of the tariff on to their customers.</p><p>The study also examines the effect of the tariffs that China has put on American products in retaliation. It shows that American businesses have had less success passing on the costs of those tariffs to Chinese importers, likely because of the types of goods being sold.</p><p>While China can easily swap Brazilian soybeans for American ones, the types of specialized consumer goods that China sells into the United States, like laptops and smartphones, are harder to substitute.</p><p>The researchers concluded that additional costs could be passed on to American consumers in the months to come.</p><p>“It suggests the real possibility that what the country has experienced so far is really only the short-run response to these tariffs,” said Brent Neiman, an economist at the University of Chicago and one of the study’s authors.</p><p>Mr. Trump agreed to forego a tariff increase planned for Oct. 15, when $250 billion worth of imports would have faced a 30 percent tax, up from 25 percent. But another round of tariffs is still on the table for December, in addition to the existing taxes on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods.</p><p>American officials said the December tariffs would likely be canceled if the agreement goes into effect as planned. But much of the deal still needs to be written and it will take several weeks of negotiation before a pact can be finalized.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has floated the idea of signing an agreement with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a summit of global leaders in mid-November, analysts say there are plenty of ways the fragile agreement could crumble, as happened in May.</p><p>The lack of a final deal, let alone a comprehensive agreement that ends the tariff war, is enough to stymie global growth for the foreseeable future, economists and other analysts say.</p><p>Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said this week that the latest deal between the United States and China would have little economic impact because it would only make a small dent in the trade imbalance between the two countries and because China’s currency would likely appreciate, offsetting the benefits of the canceled tariffs.</p><p>“The U.S. is attempting to pluck low-hanging fruit first, rather than hold out for a more complete trade deal with China,” Mr. Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note to clients. “But reaching an agreement on the more contentious structural issues remains an uphill battle and it still seems more likely than not that trade tensions will escalate again before long.”</p>', 'published', '2019-10-16 19:11:30', '2019-10-16 19:11:30');
